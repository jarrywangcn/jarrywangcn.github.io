&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopt a cat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopting Morty has been one of the most important things for me this year, even though it only began in October. It reflects a profound shift within me—an acceptance of responsibility, even if it’s for a cat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know myself well, and I’ve always tended to avoid responsibility whenever possible. While I’ve lived with cats before, this is the first time I’ve truly felt the weight of being solely responsible for a living being. Providing Morty with a stable life—ensuring his food, environment, and companionship—is now my duty, and I’ve embraced this reality. I even feel guilty if I go out too often in a week, which used to be natural for me. 🙃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After returning from Malta, I began house viewings and got sale agreed within two weeks—remarkably quick. Navigating the mortgage and insurance process went smoothly, but moving in May was overwhelming. Managing utilities, internet, furniture purchases and assembly, packing, and unpacking felt like an endless task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m still unsure if this marks a significant milestone for me. The decision was driven by financial considerations, yet I feel no emotional attachment to owning a home. My lifestyle remains unchanged—I still live with housemates, socialize with friends, and occasionally date. It hasn’t impacted my cash flow or consumption habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, many view homeownership as a hallmark of adulthood—so perhaps it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing, scuba diving, swimming, dancing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, I wasn’t obsessed with anything in particular—just exploring outside my comfort zone. Having spent years doing lower-body-intensive sports like running, cycling, and hiking, I decided to focus on water sports this year. That’s why I took up swimming and scuba diving. While I’m far from an expert, the goal was to feel more at ease in water and to unlock the experience of exploring an underwater world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also try dancing for a similar reason, as it’s a way to express emotions physically rather than through words or thoughts. I tried salsa and swing, finding swing suit me better—though it clearly requires more practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing has been a bigger focus, heavily influenced by friends like West, Alexis, Valerie, and Josh. I love outdoor rope climbing, as it immerses me in nature in a unique way. Feeling the texture of the rocks and being grounded in the moment has become deeply fulfilling. It&amp;rsquo;s also a interesting way for travel and make friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/owtsA3F.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience, Connection, Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year has been filled with memorable trips that deepened my bonds with friends. In Spain, Qingyue and I grew close for the first time after three years of knowing each other. In the UK, I shared in Ruoxi&amp;rsquo;s milestone moment at her PhD graduation. In the USA, I reconnected with Michael, reliving memories from our graduation eight years ago and making new memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These journeys stirred profound emotions, prompting me to write heartfelt reflections on Instagram after each trip, expressing gratitude for the people and moments shared. I even updated my status to include “Experience, Connection, Love” alongside “Cosmopolitanism, localism, culture, and history.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my younger years, I focused on achievement—not for recognition, but to push myself forward. Recent years, however, I start to value deep, meaningful connections with people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my funeral, I hope people remember not just the remarkable things I achieved but the joy and laughter I brought into their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get more feedback about I&amp;rsquo;m supportive and how I influence them in a good way 😬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get less avoidant and become more safe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank God, I no longer attract anxious types, nor am I drawn to broken people anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From April to July, I had 12 sessions with the therapist I saw two years ago. Initially, it was to address being triggered by a dating experience, but our discussions soon delved into childhood trauma. I came to realize how challenging life was from ages 8 to nearly 25, with lingering scars still present. Confronting these wounds, reminding myself “I am different now, my life has changed, I can choose new behaviors, and I am safe,” was incredibly hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m deeply grateful for undertaking this inner work, even though it’s been difficult. In return, I become more sensitive to people&amp;rsquo;s emotions as well as mine. &amp;ldquo;Pay money to therapist and learn how to be angry at my friends&amp;rdquo; 🤣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/8SQJwpj.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Hungary - Budapest, Slovakia - Bratislava, Malta (9 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: Netherlands - Amsterdam, Leiden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May:  Spain - Santander, Mallorca (10 days) w/ Qingyue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Galway (2 days) w/ Kenzie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: UK - London, Cambridge (6 days) w/ Ruoxi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: Greece - Athens, Geogeria, Armenia (14 days) w/ Damon, Hanyang, Matthew, Diane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: USA - New York, Chicago (9 days) w/ Michael, West, Alexis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: Egypt - Alexsanderia, Cairo, Dahab (17 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 213 days compared to 207 last year. feel good about the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprised to compare data and see how much i get stronger. The end of last year, i could only do 2 pull-up, in 2024, once i could do 10 pull-up in a row (now drop to 6). And push-up is easy 20 compare to 15. I don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to calisthenics because i&amp;rsquo;m more interested in performance on climbing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m satified on my current state related to strength, cardio and flexibility&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next year: improve performance on climbing, target is 6A, and more water sports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party: 3rd year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host 9 dinner party the whole year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year the permanent seat belongs to Hanyang, Yangyang and Damon. Matthew moved to Berlin after March, Damon will move to London next year. Have more once-a-while guests. And because the dinning table in my house becomes smaller, the crew becomes smaller too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanyang hosts lots of memorable dinner party, I gave her &amp;ldquo;host of the year&amp;quot;🫡&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to think make more close friends in Dublin 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/rXLLjae.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on 2024, I’m surprised that how I’ve almost forgotten the challenges I faced at the start of the year. I feel quite lost in early spring after three years of full-time work. A dating experience triggered me and led me back to therapy, while the stress of moving to a new home weighed heavily on me. I even found myself angry at close friends for not helping — then realize I hadn’t asked for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My therapist once said, “How people emerge from difficulties isn’t shaped solely by their experiences, but by the support they receive during those times.” Perhaps that’s why these struggles haven’t left scars—because my friends stood by me, turning pain into fleeting moments rather than lasting wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing worth writing here XD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this year has felt calm—continuing along familiar paths with no extreme highs or unexpected lows. Perhaps learning to embrace a steady, uneventful year is part of the rhythm of middle-aged life. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this year I could follow my plans to achieve retire early and this requires some time and efforts, let&amp;rsquo;s see 🤞🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishes are the same as last year, hope to live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy and Healthy, me and my loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-new&#34;&gt;1. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First year cyling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cycling is definitely the most important hobby for me this year. From strava, it shows i cycled 2500km. If taking commute into consideration, would be around 3000km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Clontarf Cycling Club. ngl, the club is super Irish and middle-aged people over 40, 50, 60 and i&amp;rsquo;m a outlier. However, learned a lot from them and every time group spin, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge and fun to push myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cycling not only gives me the way to exercise, but also brings me to lots of places around Dublin i&amp;rsquo;ve never been. Before I never go out of Dublin city center. But this year, i&amp;rsquo;ve been to Bray, Dalkey, Wicklow, Enniskerry, Killakee, Glencullen in the south, Portmarnock, Malahide, Swords, Skerries in the north, Lucan in the south. (Sorry, this is all the village names around Dublin suburbs.) And the group always guided me to lovely cute local coffee shop. This is the most authentic Irish experience for me as an immigrants 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First 100km in Feb &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/fd8aea2cb5464ccfac830.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;100km&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wicklow spin in May, Sally gap - Wicklow gap, i look so young with the group XD &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/b447f75857c79a5e3b73a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wicklow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike Touring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing cycling brings me is bike touring. As traveling after so many years, i know my preference is to go to local places (don&amp;rsquo;t need to be famous) and see how local people&amp;rsquo;s daily lifes and behaviors. However, because i can&amp;rsquo;t drive, i&amp;rsquo;m limited to the places I could reach by public transportation. This year, because of bike touring, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lots of interesting but niche places, as well as enjoying cycling at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots of memorable spins and a bit risky &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo; because of bike touring, such as cycle on southern freeway (Autopista Sur), carrying bike while hiking in Tenerife&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most memorable one is in Naples, I rented a bike for 3 days there. Here&amp;rsquo;s the travel notes taken back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I only stayed in the central area of Naples and had a biased impression of this multi-layered city. The closely-built, narrow alleys reminded me of the urban villages in Guangzhou. But if you go to the west coast and climb up the hill, the vibe of the neighborhood is similar to Mid-Levels in Hong Kong. It&amp;rsquo;s also similar to Lisbon and Istanbul in some ways. As it turns out, there must be some common patterns to developing cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycled to Pompeii, around Mount Vesuvius, and experienced the stone road, which made my hands and butt vibrate all the way and met traffic jam in literally every single town!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in napoli are very confident drivers, both cars and motors. They turn without signal lights, pass aside you within 0.5m. In the crossings, most of time no traffic lights, people need to negotiate with hands, facial expressions, beeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People parked anywhere, anytime. Parked 2 Columns on the same side of roads. Parked in the crossings. Parked suddenly to speak to passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t see any accident, I would say it’s a super good self-organized society 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a ferry with my bike to Ischia and had a thermal spring bath at Baia di Sorgeto, where had to manually mix the cold sea water with hot spring water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Bike Touring in Malaga, firt time with Clip Shoes and Fall, February &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/3fcb4bc8092b91c7fae01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malaga&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Climb this year in Tenerife, March! &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/453d998c77ad67d83449f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Teide&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naples in April, on the west coast looking to Vesuvius &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a36cc155ffce675286d01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Naples&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusseldorf along Rhine River in June, cycle with Diane &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/07ee84835ea222ef12da0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dusseldorf&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erhai Greenway, Dali in October &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9957c90caba38e2da1699.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dali&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get promotion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t talk much about work because i&amp;rsquo;m not ambitious on career. But still, this year i&amp;rsquo;ve made so much progress as a software engineer. Looking back, i almost didn&amp;rsquo;t do any solid work in the first one year and half. For example, i haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits in my team&amp;rsquo;s core packages, either C or Rust. But since April, I picked a very technical challenging project in Rust. So I had a steep learning curve on Rust, then our core package&amp;hellip; Then I picked another bigger both technical and design difficult project both in Go and Rust, also need to lead 2 new graduate teammates&amp;hellip; In the end, I finished them all, from knowing nothing to deliver results as well as own a big project. Then I got promoted&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often find myself starting things just as I cross the bottem passing grade, which makes the process somewhat painful, but leads to significant progress. Last year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even complete a two-day hiking trail, when i start to hike in Dolomites over 170+ kilometers…  This year, after just 2 months of owning a road bike, I joined a cycling club with the shortest group spin is over 70km. When I first got into DJing last year, I immediately started making friends in the DJ community. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt uncomfortable that I might be less skilled compared to someone else; instead, I&amp;rsquo;m always amazed by their talents and skills. I openly share what I&amp;rsquo;m into with almost everyone, which leads to more chances of serendipitously meeting like-minded people and engaging with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 3 years, I&amp;rsquo;m back in China. Actually i don&amp;rsquo;t feel strange. I still have lots of friends who could hangout together and have surprisling(&amp;hellip;) strong connection and mutal understanding. My fav pub in town still open, fav restaurant still open. Stay probably 3 weeks at home, had some family time with mom, Tiantian and Kangkang. And stay over with so many friend&amp;rsquo;s house. Thx for hosting me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/27a197f7b9a15c890c19a.png&#34; alt=&#34;china_2023&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel and stay with friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a reserved attitute about traveling with friends, the reasons are complicated and mixed. Partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable to stay with people together, partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t believe I could still keep having fun with one person. Partly because i like having adventure alone. Traveling solo will give me a adventurous feeling. But with my comfort zone with people progressing, I&amp;rsquo;ve arranged several trips with friends this year (sometimes one person, sometimes two.) Most of time, it goes well. Even something annoyed happened, I will communicate about it in the end. I do detect i don&amp;rsquo;t have fight or run situation for long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get stamp 4 (a work permit in Ireland, which don&amp;rsquo;t need company&amp;rsquo;s sponsorship)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t make lots of new friends this year, still meet  new people, sometimes during traveling, sometimes in Dublin, but not close and don&amp;rsquo;t have time to hangout. maybe i&amp;rsquo;m already very comfortable with current friend circle but anyways, why all the friends should be close friends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling: 78 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Portugal - Faro (2 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February &amp;amp; March: Spain - Malaga, Granada, Tenerife (10 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March &amp;amp; April: Italy - Rome, Neplas (11 days) w/ John, Frances, Wayne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Germany - Koln, Dusseldorf (3 days) w/ Diane; Spain - Barcelona (5 days) w/ Matthew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Swizterland &amp;amp; France - Geneva, Chamonix, Zermatt, Zurich (15 days) w/ Wayne, John, Frances, West, Alex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September &amp;amp; October: Hong Kong (2 days); China - Chaozhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, Linhai (12 days); Korean - Jeju (5 days) w/ Josh, Ying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: China - Dali (5 days) w/ Donglai &amp;amp; Iris; Hong Kong (1 day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus regions for me this year is South Europe, especailly Spain and Italy. Quote my instagram post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 3-4 months, I visited the following cities in South Europe around the Mediterranean Sea: Portugal&amp;rsquo;s Lisbon and Faro, Spain&amp;rsquo;s Malaga, Granada and Barcelona, and Italy&amp;rsquo;s Rome, Naples. If looking back a bit further, also visited Turkey&amp;rsquo;s Istanbul, Izmir, Fethiye and Antalya. Could say had a rough impression of the north Mediterranean area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in a region with a long, stable cultural history (Zhejiang is one of China&amp;rsquo;s core cultural regions since the Song Dynasty), I feel fascinated and amazed by how many culturally diverse influences have shaped the Mediterranean, including Carthage, Rome, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Arabic, and Moors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the cities I&amp;rsquo;ve visited have historical sites left by the Romans, Arabs, Carthaginians and Ottoman Turks. Over a long period, these empires&#39; borders have experienced expansion and contraction. What were once mosques have become churches in Granada, and what were once churches have become mosques in Istanbul. The alternation of civilizations happens all the time, and each time, the victors try to tell a historical narrative to prove their legitimacy while the fusion of cultures still exists in daily life and some physical objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental map in the brain often differs from the real physical world. As an Asian/Chinese, I could name almost all of Chinese provinces, their capitals, main terrains, as well as &amp;ldquo;big cities&amp;rdquo; in Western Europe, and lots of places in North America. At the same time, I was surprised to find out that the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco is less than 15 kilometers wide, Sicily is much closer to Tunis than Milan, and Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the most famous Greek cities in history, with a massive Greek community until Nasser took power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization, or cross-region and cross-continent communication, isn&amp;rsquo;t a new thing. Iconic buildings and landmarks become modern idolatry, and the world has more rough grainness before filters, which requires observation with closer distance and immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/e0aafe8519bbcc56a17bc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;granada&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 200~ days compared to 190~ last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my workout pattern become a bit different than before
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during workday, try to work on abs/back/chest for 3 times, and in summer, will go to cycling during sunset time with good weather for 12-20km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on weekends, have a loose rotation between cycling with group (70-90km), climbing with random friends, and swimming with Chenglin. oh yeah, almost missed that, this year i went swimming around 10 times and learned freestyle with help of Chenglin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do 1 hour yoga for weekends and 10 mins stretch everyday in the morning since November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my upper strength increases a lot this year, the pull-up bar are so useful and effective, at first, i need to pull up with 45kg resistance band, now i could do 2 pull-up (not good form but sill 😬).  The push-up increases from 7 dirty form to 15 clean form standard form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not hiking a lot, but becuase go for Haute Route in Switzerland this year, so still hike 267.7km in total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next year: improve freestyle swimming, also i&amp;rsquo;m interested in Calisthenics, didn&amp;rsquo;t see the possibility that i could do flag or planche next year hahaha but will see how much i could improve as standards in Convict Conditioning. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m in chest5, leg10, back5 and abs10. Next year hope to improve chest and back to 10, also work on spine and shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party: 2rd year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host 12 dinner party this year in total (not including last time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second year, don&amp;rsquo;t feel any pressure, also less excited haha, now i feel this is more like a traditional ritual for my friend circle. This year, the close circle has some changes, first, Diane moves to Paris last October, and then Hanyang moved out to Donaghmede in the far north. Obviously, we hang out less frequently than before. Both Matthew and I traveled too much to be both in Dublin (?) But more close to Yangyang. Children will always grow up and leave home. 😂 I need to accept this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will still have Jarry&amp;rsquo;s living room next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9d874b25e10fc678dfe06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dinner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back the whole year, I realized the happeniss of this year is from friends (either friends in Dublin or friends around the world), my family, travel, music, movie and cycling.
I feel so grateful and lucky that I could have so many wonderful friends hanging out with me, taking care of me, give me support; I have a healthy body and some money to do the hobbies I like, the adventure I choose; all the people who create the amaizng films, albums, live music and books (still alive or in the history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next year, I will keep all this in mind, treasure my friends and family, pay and &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; for what I love by both actions and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020&amp;rsquo;s summary, I wrote &amp;ldquo;In the past few years, a persistent issue for me has been the frequent feeling of strangeness towards my past self and a sense of detachment from my past life.&amp;rdquo; The strangeness is not only from the environment, the friend circle, but also my behavior pattern and mindset.
It sounds weird, but this year is the first time that I truly accept the current me is real me. And I will keep it&amp;rsquo;s this stage of me and probably will change in the future.
Why I feel it&amp;rsquo;s something blue, in many novels, the main character goes through challenges and hardships, returning to their hometown having achieved some success, even becoming somewhat better in some ways. Along the way, they gain friends. Yet, despite the struggles being a story that can be shared with others, you still feel a sense of sadness, a sadness that might not even be rooted in loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried when I got onboarded on the flight back to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote notes back then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weeks in Dublin, before heading back to Asia after 3 yrs. When reflecting on the past three years, the cliche summary is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve become a better version of myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s often a tendency that we want to accumulate our possessions, the titles we hold, and indulge in fancy travels and experiences to show people our identity. But what if you were suddenly stripped of all that, thrown into a completely unfamiliar world where no one understands the labels from your previous life? Would you still recognize who you truly are? I keep questioning myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 29, I hope to keep living a simpler life with few things and not depending on lots of needs, yet savor all the love and support from my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“天上浮云如白衣，斯须改变如苍狗。
古往今来共一时，人生万事无不有。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a3030875034cbbe1fd2ad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jeju&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing probably should not categorize as blue. At the beginning of this year, I know M.D. got married by accident. It still arouses mixed feelings, which combine with &amp;ldquo;Oh he got married&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I feel happy for him because he must be love her, otherwise he won&amp;rsquo;t choose to be married.&amp;rdquo; He is the most important person who influences me in so many ways in my 20s, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be another person who have similar impact on me. But I will have still my 30s, 40s and etc on my own good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same as last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life is one with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy and Healthy, me and my loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>2022 wrap up</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2022_summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 12:34:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2022_summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ps: will have a separate post about books, music and movies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-new&#34;&gt;1. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first long multi-day (11 days) hiking with 10kg+ backpack in Italy, Dolomites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;details and photos on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci0FMghqwOQ&#34;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt;, best travel experience this year and makes me want to do multi-day hiking every year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn &amp;ldquo;feel it before thinking&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is one of the biggest change in recent years. As person who loves and trusts logic and knowledge, when i was young, logic is more important and higer than body/feeling and have strong preference about words, all the things which could express in a logical way (which means you could reason and summarize patterns).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if i&amp;rsquo;m interested in running, i will buy several books about running and read it first. If i&amp;rsquo;m interested in some hiking trails, i will read articles and books about the history behind it first. There is nothing wrong, but a very limited perspective. Hiking and into natures teaches me how to let my body feel it rather than thinking about the history and society first. (Do I really care about the civilization history of Lycian way? A bit, but not that much. I just want to be between moutains and oceans.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn how to ask for help and communicte effectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/being_connected/&#34;&gt;Being Connected&lt;/a&gt;, I asked help from professional therapist. When i feel down in April, I tell my friends that i need their emotional support and company. When I want to hang out with friends but don&amp;rsquo;t have energy to prepare something, I will directly say to Damon &amp;ldquo;Could we hang out at your place and you prepare the food, i could bring some meals and drinks?&amp;rdquo; haha😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn how to construct my life without moving to new city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 15 yrs old, the longest time i&amp;rsquo;ve lived in one city is 4 yrs for university, then keeping moving cities every year or every two year. because of citizenship requirement of staying in dublin for 5 yrs, i have the worries and uncomfort. Moving will definitely give you new experience and excitement. After around half a year in Dublin, I feel bored and have the impulse to leave. Then i start to learn how to contrust my life and experience new things without moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experience new activities with old friends and tell myself old and familar friends are important even though they are not as interesting as new friends sometimes 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn new interests and make friends based on that. Last year, it&amp;rsquo;s more about electronic music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;travel abroad every month to get freshed. I could say I had a quite amazing year based in Dublin and don&amp;rsquo;t afriad to live here for 4 more years with new ways of learning and improving in other ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;emotional health and relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;details in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/being_connected/&#34;&gt;Being Connected&lt;/a&gt;, spend so much time and energy on this project in the last 2 yrs&amp;hellip; (friend: please don&amp;rsquo;t treat it as a project)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start to learn cooking after moving to Dublin and hosted first dinner party with Josh, Diane, Damon in last December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after cooking for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit easy to cook single meal, then designing a menu, time management of cooking more than 6 meals, sharing food with friends interests me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this year hosted 14 times, guests grow from 3 to 8 people and the nubmer never goes down. 😂 because some become permanent residents and there are always new friends to join us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so much fun and memory from this series, hope could keep doing it next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;electronic music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to lots of eletronic music before and never been to gig, the first one is March this year and bought a mixer in June, make some new friends and been to around 20 gigs, the most intense period is once a week&amp;hellip; now is once a month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;play music for people twice and uploaded a mix &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/jarrywan9/be-water&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/jarrywan9/be-water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t played it for months but such an interesting genre, had fun, maybe will pick up again some day (hope so)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;giving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the best review from Hanyang and Diane &amp;ldquo;Thx Jarry for adopting me in Dublin&amp;rdquo;. realized now i could give people lots of good stuff, sometimes as a good friend, sometimes as a random person with information people need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when getting older, start to meet younger generation&amp;hellip; still not clear about this part, but definitly start to give more than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some random stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start to use makeup, nail polish and wear dresses more frequently. become used to feel comfortable to dress like a female&amp;hellip; it could be a long paragraph about how to accept my gender but i&amp;rsquo;m lazy&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;know what&amp;rsquo;s great x feel like. terrific x doesn’t mean everything, okay x doesn’t worth efforts, next one is always better XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start to do orthodontics since July&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling: 60 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: Turkey - Izmir, Dalaman, Antalya, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Midyat (14 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: UK - London (4 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: UK - London, Portmouth (3 days); Spain - Barcelona (6 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: Italy - Milan, Venice, Bressanone, Feltre, Dolomites Alta Via 2 (16 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: Spain - Madrid (3 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: UK - Cambridge, Manchester, Lake District (4 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: Portugal - Lisbon (6 days), Faro (2 days); France - Paris (4 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t have any goals about traveling because it just takes time. it&amp;rsquo;s a habit not a goal. but still have some plans and find something new this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;realized i need to stay for a city/ region for at least 4+ days, otherwise didn&amp;rsquo;t get the sense of being there, or just being there physically. that&amp;rsquo;s my feelings about Milan &amp;amp; Madrid trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of travel time is spent with friends, especially city trips, have unforgettable memories with old friends, will keep doing that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start to make friends during traveling. in the last 10 yrs of traveling, it&amp;rsquo;s very rare for me to make friends, exchange contact numbers, keep touch after separating. even though staying in hostel, just stay away from people. this year, i make several friends which we could meet again if we have chance in the same city, or at least exchange social media to keep updated. i think the reason is that i could make connections with people now even though it&amp;rsquo;s weak connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 190~ days compared to 175~ last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have really good sleep quality, almost no dreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t have big difference about the frequency, but still have some changes
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start to do more weight exercise and target to specific muscles. because i did more workout like yoga, running, hiking etc before, i have very strong leg muscles while the upper body is quite weak. start to use resistence bands, go bloudering to exercise muscles of butt, back and chest. not very impressive progress, but will keep doing this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hiking a lot. i start to do hiking in 2018 living in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. and i didn&amp;rsquo;t hike that much. in 2020, hiked 17 times with around 204 km. in 2021, hiked 10 times with 81 km, 3529m. this year, hiked 21 times with 315 km, 15997m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;already know next year will do lots of cycling, hope won&amp;rsquo;t have any accidents 🤞🏼&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thx for having a good health to do so many things in 1 yr 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after leaving china for around 3 yrs, currently, my friend circle is like that
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close friends in Dublin, normally hang out every 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close friends not in Dublin which still talk every 2-3 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;old friends which don&amp;rsquo;t talk but could meet if we are in the same city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new friends in Dublin, hang out if there are some activites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new acquaintances around the world&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i have similar opinons abuot friendship and romantic relationship, at least people need to respect mutally, could have good time together, try to understand and support each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no matter how long we separated, you could still feel understood, seen and supported by some friends. will finally meet some friends in China in 2023!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some random stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;still organize an event to let some presenters sharing experience and information about migrating and working in ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spend some time on consultion of cv, mock interviews etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thx a million to my dear younger brother - Tiantian. one night in December, he texted me he and dad were in hospital emergency room because dad felt uncomfortable about this heart and turns out he has blood vessel blockage. Tiantian signed the documents for operations while my mom was in another city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t remember anything could put in this part. only break my heart in April but already moved on the whole things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there is nothing difficult happened the whole year, but my mental resilience has been improved, also with safety net based on friends&#39; emotional support, healthy physical body and stable life state. so didn&amp;rsquo;t fall into any mental breakdown and emotional abyss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general, have a good mental health this year and smiled a lot. Donglai said &amp;ldquo;Your face don&amp;rsquo;t have the misery of East Asians now&amp;rdquo; one night, walking back from a dance party or dinner at friends&#39;, met one passenger on the street, asked me &amp;ldquo;why you&amp;rsquo;re so happy&amp;quot;😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last year, in this seesion, i wish i could hang out with people less and give more time to myself. from records, last year there are 130+ days hanging out with people compared to 180+ days this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several reasons 1. i&amp;rsquo;ve traveled for 60 days these years compared to 10 days last year. 2. i start to do sports with friends and dance with friends, I do hang out with people a lot but it also contributes to my interest about hiking, bloudering and eletronic music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my ideal state now is: people will feel relaxed and happy with me (realized could make people feel relaxed is a rare and precious character), and my complexity and depth based on the experience, knowledge and mindset. just chill is so boring. think i already achieve this state in some degrees : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quote from this &lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/2049935/what-does-a-good-life-look-like&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life is one with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i was early 20s, i&amp;rsquo;m afriad of being 30s because seeing lots of 30s people trapped in their boring life and keep unchanged for so many years. I&amp;rsquo;m so close to 30s now, i don&amp;rsquo;t fear it at all. The age doesn&amp;rsquo;t limit myself to make changes and have new improvements and adventure. i&amp;rsquo;m so proud of myself about this year and see u next year : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Being Connected</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/being_connected/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 20:14:55 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/being_connected/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is written in English because I feel more comfortable to talk about feelings in English than Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would post a blog about this topic. But people change : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a TV show called Bojack Horseman, people will find they feel related to the characters. I feel related to Bojack most, because I&amp;rsquo;ve hurt people when I was an teenager and early 20s. I would apologize and thought I have already apologized, people should forgive me, but it&amp;rsquo;s their rights to not forgive. I blame myself because of this pattern for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also know this behavior pattern is learned from my father, I spend many years to break this cycle. I said to myself, I should never hurt people&amp;rsquo;s feelings on purpose and never say hurtful words to people. When I was young, I feel pround of being mean, quote myself &amp;ldquo;Being mean is a kind of wit.&amp;rdquo; I have confidence that I&amp;rsquo;m not like my father for at least 3-4 yrs, and I&amp;rsquo;m not like my mother, either. I&amp;rsquo;m totally different from them. Living with parents and younger brothers for 2 years before moving in Ireland, although upset sometimes, I improved the communication and relationship among the family members and hardly lost my temper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made lots of efforts to control my emotions. If recall back, maybe 4-5 years ago, I objectize myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t think myself is important, just a small part of objective world. I&amp;rsquo;m obessed into society, culture, history, architecture, everything outside of me and has nothing related to myself or people. The rare time I feel connected is when I was in the nature, as a small part of universe. I lived thousands of kilometers far away from family and friends and didn&amp;rsquo;t looking for connections. I just visited friends in Shanghai or other cities once or twice every year, family too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time flies. To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how this happens. But once when I was in Shanghai in 2020, I&amp;rsquo;m talking with DongLai, said I&amp;rsquo;m bothered that every time I visit Shanghai, I have lots of friends to meet, I made the busy schedule, every friend have one meal time, and I feel exhausted. One 10-year friend asked me &amp;ldquo;Why you can&amp;rsquo;t spend more time with me?&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer when she asked but then realized because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to admit some peopel are more special for me even if they are. Donglai invited me to stay over at her house and I said okay, then cancelled the plan tomorrow with someone not so close to me. That&amp;rsquo;s an important moment/decision for me, I know it sounds weird.😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The friendship is so difficult, not to mention romantic relationship. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any dates during 2014 - 2020. After arriving in Ireland, I start to try. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting experience when you didn&amp;rsquo;t have any physical or mental intimacy with anyone for a long time. After several dates, I found I finishes with people after 1-2 months because of small reasons even I feel well in the beginning. I asked one friend, how he decides to continue to date with someone or not. He said &amp;ldquo;Just follow your emotions.&amp;rdquo; I said &amp;ldquo;The problem is I don&amp;rsquo;t have emotions&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Another reason why I finish early maybe is I&amp;rsquo;m afraid people will leave me sooner or later, so I leave them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to make my emotions back, but I decide to break the pattern of finishing early. After moving in Dublin last autumn, I met S. He is a really nice guy. He treats me really well and I thought I also did well, I will plan the dates, cook dinner, give gifts. When he said &amp;ldquo;I feel you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in me, you talked about our common interests but don&amp;rsquo;t care how&amp;rsquo;s my day&amp;rdquo;, I was surprised because things are smooth from my side. (My therapist said because i didn&amp;rsquo;t learn to care &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rsquo;s your day&amp;rdquo; during my life). Donglai and OY agrees it must be my fault, my emotional involement is obviously not enough. In the same time, I read the attachment theory and conclude I&amp;rsquo;m a avodiant type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met D. This time, I really try to invole emotionally and behave like a secure attachment style. But the situation is more complicated. First, he&amp;rsquo;s great and nice to me, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want closeness at this period. He&amp;rsquo;s working on setting boundaries with people. And I&amp;rsquo;m working on being close to people, basically, we are on the opposite direction. Second, because I really like him and involve emotionally, I start to feel unsecure and anxious. I read several books, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help much. In the end, he decides to finish and I also know it&amp;rsquo;s the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good side of this experience is 1. I start to involve emotionally and my emotion is back. 2. I still could have strong feelings for people after 8 yrs lack of passion. 3. I learned a lot from him about being honest of my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reflection is 1. I will feel unsecure if I&amp;rsquo;m close to person, and obviously my self-regulation is not good as I assume. 2. Even though you like someone, it&amp;rsquo;s not good relationship if it starts to have negative influence. Pay attention to which kind of yourself he brings out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the time I should ask for help, which is also my last year&amp;rsquo;s wish. So I start to visit therapist first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first thereapy, in the beginning, she (N) &amp;ldquo;the first session normally we will just talk about your life story and what you want from the therapy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I saw her take notes full of 2 pages of A4 paper, she &amp;ldquo;this time we just talked about your childhood history, maybe we need another 2 or 3 sessions to finish this process&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sighed &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;hellip; i know my life story is complicated&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N asked me &amp;ldquo;what are you looking for from therapy?&amp;rdquo;
I hope 1. I could be more secure style in the close relationship 2. I could learn better to like/love people in the way they feel more comfortable. 3. I want to clear about what i&amp;rsquo;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As OY said, it&amp;rsquo;s an self-exploration journey, let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three parts are written in June, and it&amp;rsquo;s December now. haha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have therapy since May to November for 16 times. At first 9 sessions, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve cried for around 10 pieces of tissues. It&amp;rsquo;s not about how I finished with D but what happens between my parents in my teenager time. To be honest, i&amp;rsquo;m surprised about my reactions. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought I&amp;rsquo;ve already gotten over of it and become strong enough, it&amp;rsquo;s just the past. The fact is I surpress the feelings for many years and I was so broken before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of time, when therapist asked me &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s your feeling about that?&amp;rdquo; I answered &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I forgot the feelings, just remember the moment.&amp;rdquo; So during the therapy, sometimes she will let me stop talking and feel the emotions. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t keep distracting yourself from the feeling.&amp;rdquo; and she suggested me to search and learn some feelings words XD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, I decided to end therapy because I feel confident about my ability to face my emotions and how to behave to build connection with people and will stop dealing with this actively for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall back how lonely I was before. Although I have lots of friends but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been close and fully open to them. This year it&amp;rsquo;s the first time in my life that there is a close friend circle for me. My previous friendship pattern is hanging out once or twice every year and live far away from all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my diary records, the whole year of 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve only have conversations with friends and strangers for 38 times. This year is 172 times until today 😅  I didn&amp;rsquo;t count how many times i&amp;rsquo;ve hang out with my close friends circle in Dublin including Diane, Damon and Hanyang, but almost once a week at least and I remembered I&amp;rsquo;ve hanged out with Daine 3 times a week before she moved to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the dinner party at my house, I feel so comfortable and secure because i&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by friends I&amp;rsquo;m so familar and trust and know they also feel the same about me. We hang out not because I want some new stories or inspirations from them. It&amp;rsquo;s the most close feeling that I could imagine the feelings with family expect my brothers 😊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to guys, I met S (another S wit the same name, maybe i have preference about name lmao) in July. When we finished in September, I clearly know it&amp;rsquo;s not my fault and I do nothing wrong. Actually, with more knowledge about emotions and attachment theory, I feel more understanding about his behaviors, fear and disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I met M in an unexpected situation in the end of this year. Without opportunity to build connections more but I still feel grateful for this experience. Glad to know there are guys I feel attracted living and experiencing happily in the world. Life is a journey for my own and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to meet someone on the road and have a good time together, long or short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;6&#34;&gt;6&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conlcusion, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved so much improvements about my emotions and relationship security. Being sensitive means I will be easily get hurt. But it also gives more experience and perspectives about world. Have feelings doesn’t mean I&amp;rsquo;m weak. I could suppress my negative feelings for short-term, but they will still be there and come back some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m clear about what i&amp;rsquo;m looking for. After 2 yr&amp;rsquo;s dating experience, I realized I don&amp;rsquo;t like easily compatibale people, which means they could date with people if she reaches some standards such as appearance, job, some of nomral personality. Different people has different uniqueness. For the same unique point, some people like it, some people feel it&amp;rsquo;s werid. For me, most of people are similar and some uniqueness are not my taste. Also, I could only fall in love if someone likes me because of my uniqueness and I see him too. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for the one I see and like the werid uniquesness and don&amp;rsquo;t care about the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, I accept myself more and open to other people, can&amp;rsquo;t imagine I could express this kind of thing on the Internet before. More brave to express my needs and prepare to get hurt and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People change and i&amp;rsquo;m glad I could change. Looking forward to what will happen in the future. : )&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>普通读者二零二一阅读总结</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_reading/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 18:35:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_reading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;很喜欢播客《普通读者》介绍的伍尔夫定义的普通读者的概念, “不同于批评家和学者，他受教育程度较低，也没有过人的天资。他读书是为了消遣，而不是为了传授知识或纠正他人的看法。” 拿来做标题.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二零二一年共读了110+本书, 大头是漫画(33)、推理/科幻小说(26)、文学(18), 抛去这些, 零散地读了几本历史和自然写作.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;非虚构&#34;&gt;非虚构&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;自然写作&#34;&gt;自然写作&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《海鸟的哭泣》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;沉迷观鸟的朋友推荐, 被连续安利了两年也没入坑的我被这本书深深吸引. 如同作者在引言中所说“我们无法从其他任何角度来理解对每种动物而言‘有意义的世界’, 除非是通过它们自身的角度…… ‘周遭世界’具有多样性, 所有生物都凭借各自的‘周遭世界’以独特的方式感知着这个世界, 我们钥匙无法接受这一点, 那么到头来, 就会不可避免地用单一等级来给所有事物排位, 而这种等级, 是以人类自身的标准来衡量的.” 海鸟的感官世界自然迥异于人类, 但即使同为人类, 我们也时常不能理解他人所处的境况, 除非我们去了解他们看到的世界是怎么样的, 他们日常关心的问题是什么. 如果我们总是以自身所处的小团体的价值观作为单一的评价标准去判断他人的价值, 就容易陷入攀比、虚荣、焦虑的情绪. 意识并且尊重世界和人类的多样性, 保持开放性在不同尺度上都具有意义.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《鳗鱼的旅行》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这本书是鳗鱼相关的科普和与父亲共处的鳗鱼回忆构造了人类与自然的entanglement(纠缠), 反思人类所在意的哲学问题(这个部分我不是很喜欢), 过去常见的自然科普读书通常只能看到自然和动物在那里, 作者是隐形的, 如今英国有一类作家非常喜欢把自然和私人史/回忆写在一起. 挺喜欢这种写法, 许多人喜欢大自然多是因为能从自然中获得慰藉. 欧洲鳗鱼出生在大西洋西北部的马尾藻海, 刚出生时是透明的柳叶鳗(形如柳叶), 到达欧洲海岸是成长为玻璃鳗, 之后会在陆地的淡水中度过他们的成年期. “别无选择时, 它们甚至可以游走在陆地上, 游过湿润的灌木丛和草地, 坚持若干小时, 直到抵达新的水域.” 当它们长途跋涉后找到他们喜欢的水域, 就会待在那里, “年复一年, 通常只在一个半径几百米的范围内活动”, 鳗鱼可以活到80到100岁, 但通常在15岁到30岁之间, 当它们决定繁殖时, 他们会开始回到出生的马尾藻海. 在旅途中, 他们的生殖器官会发育, “消化系统完全停止了运转, 胃被溶解到了, 它们所需的能量都从脂肪储备中获得, 体内满是鱼卵或鱼精.” 他们每天都要游进50公里, 旅行时间通常在半年左右, 当它们会到马尾藻海, 鱼卵在海藻下受精, 鳗鱼便死去了. 更神秘的是, 在很长一段时间, 从来没有人见过一条鳗鱼让另一条鳗鱼的卵受精, 也没有人成功地在人工养殖的环境下让鳗鱼繁殖, 直到1973年, 北海道大学的日本科学家才成功的让日本鳗鱼人工受精. 吃了不少鳗鱼饭的我从来没想过鳗鱼是那么有意思的生物.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《创造自然》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本科学德语时就听过洪堡兄弟, 柏林洪堡大学因洪堡兄弟命名, 柏林洪堡基金会以弟弟亚历山大·冯·洪堡为名, 而书里告诉我“墨西哥的洪堡山脉（Sierra Humboldt）和委内瑞拉的洪堡峰（Pico Humboldt）,阿根廷的一座城镇、巴西的一条河流、厄瓜多尔的一股间歇泉、哥伦比亚的一处海湾——都以洪堡命名。” 出生于十八世纪的洪堡曾于南美洲、美国、中亚进行探险, 在探险过程中形成了他整体的自然观, “洪堡站在钦博拉索山巅，满身疲惫地注视着眼前的景象。这里的植被分布带依次层叠：山谷里有棕榈树林和潮湿竹林，色彩鲜艳的兰花攀附在树干上。再往上，洪堡看到针叶树、橡树、赤杨以及成丛的小檗灌木，与他在欧洲森林里见到的十分相似；然后是高山植物，与他在瑞士山中采集的一样；另外还有地衣——这让他想起从极地和芬兰极北端的拉普兰区带回的样本。从未有人用这样的方式看待过植物的分布：不再局限于分类学的狭窄范畴，而是根据所在区域和气候，把它们分成不同的类型。洪堡将自然看作一种覆盖全球的力量，各大陆都有相对应的气候带。这种视角在当时相当独特，但今天仍然影响着我们对于生态系统的理解。” 亚历山大·冯·洪堡给予我们关于自然的观念, 他开创了地理的许多重要概念, 从等温线、等压线、洋流、植被的水平与垂直分布、气候带分布、大陆性与海洋性气候. 洪堡占据了整个中学地理&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;洪堡并非是严肃的科学家, 他是路子很野的科学家. 早在童年时期，他就以言语刻薄出名，一位家庭友人唤他为“坏心肠的小鬼”。22岁时获得矿井监察员的职位, 既为自己击败不少年长的竞争对手感到尴尬, 又忍不住给朋友和家人写长信炫耀. 有一次，他从伦敦订购了一台新式脱粒机，马上兴奋地告诉朋友：“我每天都翘首以待。”时而又像个孩子一样失望地抱怨：“怎么还没收到我的脱粒机？”最后，他雀跃地欢呼：“它终于运抵纽约啦！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《活山》&amp;amp;《在雪山和雪山之间》&amp;amp;《进入空气稀薄地带》&amp;amp;《14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年读了三本爬山有关的书, 看了一部纪录片. 虽然爬山已经算是比较小众的爱好, 但也各有各的喜好. 有些人爬山是喜欢山上的一草一木一花一叶, 可以置身于同样的山无数次, 每次都能发现不同的乐趣. 他们不在乎山有多高, 有多险, 甚至不够壮美. 有些人爬山是为了挑战自我, 享受向上攀登对体能的挑战, 总想着去攀登更高更难的山, 雪山、高海拔、危险更能释放他们的肾上腺激素. 《活山》和《在雪山和雪山之间》的作者是前面一类人, 《活山》的作者Nan Shepherd一生都住在苏格兰阿伯丁, 整本书写的都是附近的Cairn Gorm山区, Nan探访了无数次, 她可以给Cairn Gorm的山、水、霜、空气、植物、鸟兽昆虫各写一章颂歌. 有意思的是Nan写“我们对事物的热情与自身生理特性的相关程度, 要远远大于我们承认的程度. 近视的人对山的热爱绝对不及那些远视眼. 我爱山, 那是因为我的身体在高山的稀薄空气里表现最好, 这种轻快的感觉被传递到大脑, 让我感到神清气爽. ” 我22岁前出去玩从来都是城市游的, 转变成现在去哪里玩, 先查查附近有什么不错的徒步路线, 想想也是挺奇妙的. 按Nan的思路想, 可能是从小体能就不错, 本来就喜欢跑步这类靠腿脚的有氧运动, 爬山比跑步更有趣, 仗着体力好, 看到还不错的山就自己去了, 二零二零年在国内爬的太开心了. 另外, 的确也不近视&amp;hellip; 《在雪山和雪山之间》的作者乔阳也是女性, 她在云南的梅里雪山和白马雪山生活多年, 最喜爱的应该是山里的植物. 云南的高原植被们真的太可爱了! 苏格兰高地这可比不了! 附上友邻子文东整理的第二章的植物对照表. &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.douban.com/review/12754351/&#34;&gt;《给被植物报菜名搞晕了的读者 - 第二章相关植物对照表》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《进入空气稀薄地带》和《14 Peaks》是第二类人的故事. 我也属于第一类人, 所以对于“征服高山”的故事兴趣缺缺, 珠峰希拉里台阶堵塞和商业登山公司的报道更加深了我对此的负面印象. 《进入空气稀薄地带》写的是1996年攀登珠峰的一次山难, 19位攀登者去世了12人. 就像前面《海鸟的哭泣》里所说的, 你无法去要求别人认为什么是有意义的, 什么是没有意义的. 有些人就是对爬上珠峰有执念, 攀登珠峰需要支付给商业登山公司6.5万美元, “来自美国的邮政工人汉森身材瘦长结实，不善言谈，饱经风霜的脸让人想起放了气的足球。他为了支付这次旅程的费用，他没日没夜地干，白天在建筑工地干活，晚上加夜班”. 某种意义上“他们也付出了自己的代价”, 心理分析部分还有山难发生时不同人的行动和反应特别精彩. 《14 Peaks》是成功者的故事, Nimsdai Purja是尼泊尔人, 他还有另外的夏巴人组成登山队在六个月零六天中完成了攀登地球上所有超过8000m海拔的山峰. 对珠峰登山史感兴趣的朋友或多或少都听过“夏巴人”, 大多数商业登山公司都是西方人发起, 但会雇佣夏巴人和藏族人, 他们负责所有后勤, 包括背行李(含氧气罐), 开道, 做饭, 搭帐篷, 好让付了钱的登山者可以轻装上阵. 高昂的登山费用只有极少数会支付给夏巴人, 夏尔巴人每年赚取的也仅6000~7000美金. The world should give more respect and credits to Nepali mountaineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;历史&#34;&gt;历史&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《她来自马里乌波尔》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年最喜欢的非虚构作品, 背景是二战期间乌克兰到德国的强制劳工, 以前只有读到过零星几句与此相关的文字, 强制劳工通常是犹太人的注脚. 第一部分娜塔莎·沃丁一路像侦探一下挖出母亲令人惊叹的家族史, 第二部分写母亲的姐姐莉迪娅的故事, 最后两章终于回到母亲从出生到自杀, 整个家族经历了苏联的大清洗大刘芳, 纳粹德国的强制劳役和战后德国对乌克兰移民的恶意. 故事难以置信, 却又如此的真实. 联想到这段时间巴以冲突, 犹太大屠杀的政治资本对以色列如今的国际地位起到了多少的作用, 而以色列却对巴勒斯坦人民实行种族歧视, 人类历史和当下现状的残酷性令人无言.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《向您告知，明天我们一家就要被杀》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读史时总会遇到某些历史事件, 会忍不住问“How could this happen?” 卢旺达大屠杀就是其中之一, 1994年, 卢旺达胡图族对图西族展开屠杀, 100天内有至少80万人遇害. 我没有深入了解过此次事件, 书里最令我震惊的是, 在事件发生的当时, 国际组织介入在边境乌干达建立难民营, 但难民营里更多的是施害者胡图族而不是图西族(How could this happen?). 国际社会既承认种族大屠杀发生了, 但有不大情愿帮助突袭人, 可能是因为不想承认一开始无所作为是错误的, 又似乎不明白需要有人付出代价. 卢旺达大屠杀既是因为当地本身的民族冲突, 又是因为国际社会的无所作为.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1994年后, 联合国也不让卢旺达自己处理犯罪审判(How could this happen?), “有一天，我去司法部看望杰拉德·加希玛。“审判进行得怎么样？”我问他，他摇摇头。几个月来，政府各部的部长们周游全国各地，从一所监狱到另一所监狱，分发种族灭绝法的副本，并解释说，绝大多数囚犯如果愿意认罪，可以给他们减刑。但囚犯们拒绝主动认罪。“这是故意捣乱，”加希玛说，“他们的领导人给他们洗脑了。他们还指望能坚持说这个国家没发生种族灭绝，而事实真相是种族灭绝仍在继续。”1997年12月中旬，美国国务卿马德琳·奥尔布赖特在亚的斯亚贝巴向非洲统一组织发表了一次演说，她说：“我们，国际社会，应该更积极地介入1994年卢旺达暴行的早期阶段，并且承认那些暴行实际上就是种族灭绝。”奥尔布赖特在非洲之行期间将对卢旺达进行短暂访问，同时她还谴责了动用人道主义援助去“维持武装营地或支持种族灭绝凶手”的行为。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好在, 三十年后的卢旺达, 从2003年到新冠疫情爆发前, 每年经济增长率超过7%, 2017年被世界经济论坛被评为世界最安全国家及目的地第九名. 在马蜂窝和豆瓣日记上找到的华人旅行游记体验也不错.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《仿制药的真相》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;情节很像《坏血》, 讲很多仿制药厂商(主要是印度,因为印度最多)在制药过程中有很多违规操作, 质量也很差, 但美国药监局因为各种原因, 有点纵容这些公司的行为(贪污腐败勾结官僚主义), 以及这些制药公司给美国的都算差的里面好些的, 给非洲南美有些国家的完全没有用或者有很多不良症状, 又想到讲美国阿片类药物上瘾的《Dopesick》, 感觉美国经常出这种事情, 药物和食品安全管理特别严格, 民众们对健康也特别上心, 却又经常出这类大丑闻, 但转头想想, 也可能是美国能等到真相大白, 著作出版的一天.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;文学&#34;&gt;文学&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《房思琪的初恋乐园》&amp;amp;《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》&amp;amp;《厌女》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这三本书分别是小说, 纪实文学以及学术著作, 放在一起讲因为同是女性议题. 《房思琪的初恋乐园》是基于亲身遭遇写的女性被年长(且为老师)的男性性侵并以“爱”之名长期伤害最终导致受害者罹患精神疾病自杀的故事. 《桶川跟踪狂杀人事件》是女性被男性跟踪、威胁并且最终雇佣杀害, 而原本应该保护人民的国家警察由于自身的厌女倾向未曾采取任何措施, 以及新闻界和社会大众对受害者的荡妇羞辱和无端臆测. 《厌女》是上野千鹤子作为社会学家和女性主义学者对“厌女”这一议题的呈现.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每当有男性说“男女已经很平等了” “为什么要制造性别对立”, 我只想问“上面所说的一切是不是真实发生以及预期会再次发生的” 而性别反转后, 同样的事情发生的概率是不是更小? 我们什么时候听说过一个男性因为一个女性的才华而爱上她? 男作家只会把女性和与女性的爱情作为灵感的来源, 女性是被物化成灵感的来源, 是为了和同性的男作家竞争. 什么时候听说过“荡夫羞辱”? 男的性生活活跃就是“兄弟牛逼”, 女的就是欲求不满.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《伊斯坦布尔》&amp;amp;《名誉》&amp;amp;《无止境的逃离》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十月去土耳其的旅游读物, 《伊斯坦布尔》是帕慕克写给自己青春和故乡的情书, 挺能理解为何此书或者帕慕克能被各国读者接受, 大家心里都有浪漫化的回不去的故乡, 是怀旧的寄托. 帕慕克书写的“呼愁”是将他对家庭和社会阶层反叛的苦闷揉进队城市的解读, 并没有更多跟更广大的土耳其联结的部分.《名誉》的内核是有些老生常谈的现代vs传统, 无神论vs宗教, 男性vs女性的冲突. 讲述土耳其出生的两个双胞胎, 姐姐随丈夫移民伦敦, 妹妹留在故乡独居成为助产士和医生. 当上一辈人在无奈中被迫半接受了居住在“西方”的代价, 最“传统”的思想却回到了伦敦出生的大儿子身上. 前两本书好读是好读的, 但或多或少是被人讲述过无数次的故事. 适合旅途中带着消遣的心情阅读的, 而《无止境的逃离》却如同在心上开了一枪. 故事的大背景是难民问题, 土耳其作为中东难民逃往欧洲最后一道关卡, 有不计其数的难民过路、停留在此地. 在伊斯坦布尔的五天, 听到本地人抱怨Taksim广场如今多是难民, 治安不好, 伊斯坦布尔人都搬出来了. 在周边吃饭喝酒时平均每小时碰到包着头巾怀里抱着幼儿的中东女性乞讨. 此书并不是传统的难民叙事, 故事的主角加萨的父亲从事难民运输, 他从小帮父亲干点灵活. 当父亲死亡时, 他接受了父亲的工作. 很难去描述这本书, 像是不断dig deep的电子乐. 内心独白的部分可以媲美陀思妥耶夫斯基的《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《云游》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;或许是历史读的较多, 太着地了, 很长一段时间不喜欢非现实性的、非叙事的、实验性强的文本, 而奥尔加·托卡尔丘克让我重新体会到神话和寓言的美丽. 云游的形式是对当代人信息摄入的戏仿, 无数碎片的信息在脑海中融汇成你对世界的理解. 之前夸过福克纳和鲁尔福是如何突破线性叙事, 但还是有迹可循的. 而托卡尔丘克是完全打碎了, 你找不到模式或者是线, 但作品最终还是浮现了图景. 这本书还有个很奇妙的是它很少景物, 也很少细节, 主要靠年头、事实和对话堆砌出的氛围.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《天使望故乡》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wolfe has his own voice and the feeling he expresses are so strong and unique but also common when people feel lost in the early time of life. also reminds me of another American writer John Irving (maybe both write family topics.) 天才的编辑》过来的, 沃尔夫影响还挺大的, 冯内古特也很喜欢他, 感受最深的可能是夏天去港口自力更生的日子 想到大学时去东南亚穷游, 年轻精力旺盛又很迷茫的时候需要身体上的自虐带来精神的稳定😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;推理科幻&#34;&gt;推理/科幻&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年读了这么多推理科幻的主因是工作有些累, 没有力气读一些需要消耗能量的书, 但我又是需要阅读的. 推理和科幻这种类型文学是我的junk /comfort food. 也意外的发现了几个喜欢的作家.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-jeffery-deaver-杰夫里迪弗&#34;&gt;1. Jeffery Deaver 杰夫里·迪弗&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;犹记得中学时期在亚马逊还是99读书人上凑单买了本《人骨拼图》, 但因为封面太丑了以及想读清单keep growing从没打开读过. 今年也忘了什么契机在微信读书上开始阅读, 结果一个月里读了四本“林肯·莱姆”系列. 莱姆作为刑事鉴定学家依靠凶杀现场的微小证据来寻找凶手, 但由于一次意外导致浑身瘫痪. 阿米莉亚是一名警察, 后来成为迪弗的合作伙伴. 喜欢这个系列一部分是人物塑造的比较成功, 虽然也是俗套的高智商加心灵创伤的主角. 另一部分是专业背景的破案过程非常刺激.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaver的生平也很有意思, “杰夫里•迪弗一九五〇年出生于芝加哥，十一岁时写出了他的第一本小说，从此笔耕不辍。迪弗毕业于密苏里大学新闻系，后进入福德汉姆法学院研修法律。在法律界实践了一段时间后，他在华尔街一家大律师事务所开始了律师生涯。他兴趣广泛，曾自己写歌唱歌，进行巡演，也曾当过杂志社记者。与此同时，他开始发展自己真正的兴趣：写悬疑小说。一九九〇年起，迪弗成为一名全职作家。除了犯罪侦探小说，作为美食家的他还有意大利美食方面的书行世。” : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;迪弗系列至今还读了《棺材舞者》,《冷月》和《致命雕刻》, 明年应该会继续读他的作品&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-stieg-larsson-斯蒂格拉森&#34;&gt;2. Stieg Larsson 斯蒂格·拉森&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年读完了Stieg Larsson的《千禧年三部曲》, 又是中学时代非常火我却一直拖着没读的作品. 是今年最喜欢的一个系列. 比起推理小说, 整个系列更有冒险小说的味道. 和一般的推理小说不同, 三部曲之间的情节联系非常紧密, 最后的大boss更像是为了主角的成长设立, 而不是典型推理小说凶手与主角多是无关的.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可惜的是Stieg于二零零四年去世, 甚至没有见到首部《龙文身的女孩》出版.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;贴一下Stieg的生平, “斯蒂格·拉森，瑞典作家与新闻记者。曾任职于瑞典中央新闻通讯社，并于工作之余投身反法西斯主义的活动。一九九五年，他创办了Expo基金会，并自一九九九年开始担任基金会同名杂志主编。由于他长期致力于揭发瑞典极右派组织的不法行为，多年来一直受到程度或轻或重的死亡恐吓与威胁。这部小说中总是积极捍卫社会正义、不求个人名利的男主角，几乎就是拉森本人的化身。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-jo-nesbø-尤奈斯博&#34;&gt;3. Jo Nesbø 尤·奈斯博&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年读了《五芒星》、《知更鸟》、《救赎者》, 之前也读了其他作品. 但我真的不喜欢Jo Nesbø或者是“哈利·霍勒警探”系列&amp;hellip; 那为什么读了这么多本呢, 因为没找到其他喜欢读的吧.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;讨厌的原因是哈利·霍勒这个角色其他人身上的影子太多了&amp;hellip; 感觉英国北欧还有美国一些硬汉侦探都是这种毛病&amp;hellip; 沉迷工作, 脾气不好, 跟老婆孩子关系也不好, 动不动就爱喝酒. 每次都把自己搞得特别惨, 要么是把身边的人搞得特别惨&amp;hellip; 结果因为主角光环, 总是能破案.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后贴一下Jo Nesbø “奈斯博曾是挪威知名的摇滚巨星，白天任职于金融业，利用晚上和周末时间演出。不久，他考得金融分析师执照，被挪威最大的证券公司高薪挖走。然而工作和乐团越来越难以兼顾，濒临崩溃的奈斯博决定休半年长假。他带着笔记本电脑，跳上飞机，前往澳大利亚，在那里写下了日后让自己声名大噪的“哈利•霍勒警探”系列的第一部。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;挺奇怪的, 发现当代著名侦探小说作家的人生都挺精彩的, 纯文学的作家好像现在很多背景都是学院派&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;其他&#34;&gt;其他&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《星之继承者》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本年度最近喜欢的硬科幻, 结局比较容易猜, 但剧情推理过程都特别迷人 也喜欢书中不预设立场 多收集信息和资料以求得到最合理答案的立场 考虑到年代 所以发达到太空探险的文明还在用幻灯片和解剖学确立人种也能原谅. 还读了续作2, 但第一本是硬科幻, 第二本变成science fantasy (which i don&amp;rsquo;t like it), 就没有接着读3了.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《人类灭绝》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;怎么讲, 这是我第一本读到的日本写的科幻小说, 主要故事不是发生在日本的😂 融合了科幻、人类学、悬疑、历史、化学, 情节画面感强, 故事节奏好, 非常值得推荐. 作者高野和明还有本《消失的13级台阶》也不错&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;写在最后&#34;&gt;写在最后&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;史景迁(Jonathan Spence)于2021年12月26日逝世, 第一次听到他的名字是2014年, 他是D很喜欢的历史学家. 我只读过他的《王氏之死 : 大历史背后的小人物命运》, 个人不是很喜欢书里的故事, 但是我阅读海外中国学研究以及对微观史兴趣的开始, 从那之后陆续读了罗威廉、王笛、王柯、孔飞力、柯文、曾小萍、魏斐德, 这些作品极大地影响了我对历史中国以及当代中国的认知. 当历史著作出版, 它们也成为历史的一部分, 等待感兴趣的读者借由它们去理解历史和现在. 直到现在, 仍然认为用历史的视角去看待世界是我很重要的部分. 也是为什么自我介绍里写“Photography is the only way I found comfortable to express myself. I like things which are complicated, mobile but connected. I understand world with a perspective of history and sociology but also value the power of fable and myth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有时候会怀念大约三四年前有时间有精力做专题阅读, 跟着感兴趣的主题一点点做延伸阅读, 近两年读书是东一榔头西一锤子, 但也是近两年体悟到, 生活不仅仅是只有书斋, 这两年过得也是挺充实的, 只是充实在别处. 期待明年会random读什么书.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;appendix&#34;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nature Writing Artcile Notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;发现读的许多作品都是英国人写的, Dublin的书店里几乎每个都有一整柜的“Nature writing&amp;quot;, 五月份找了几篇关于英国自然写作的文章. 这里放一下笔记.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/death-naturalist-why-new-nature-writing-so-tame&#34;&gt;Death of the naturalist: why is the “new nature writing” so tame?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这篇文章是15年写的, 写英国的野生动植物数量减少的很快, 生物多样性锐减. 而与之相反的, 英国的新自然写作类别变得非常流行. 作者觉得新的文学方式的重点之一是“re-enchantment”, 通过fine writing去重构一个景观使得景观有新的文化意义. 而在这个过程中, 景观变得越来越单一. 自然的多样性消失了. 宏观的细节——天空, 元素, 大地的轮廓和巨大的岩石保持了他们的纯洁和完整性, 而那些错综复杂的植被、泥煤基质、松鸡、黄嘴朱顶雀、環頸鶇却消失了. 作者想emphasize让写作者意识到这些现实问题. 而不是人类讨论人类, 而自然成为迷人的背景 介绍了好几个作家, 其中之一是写H Is for Hawk的Helen Macdonald. H is for Hawk拿了超多奖, Costa Book Awards还有Samuel Johnson Prize. Helen又是难得的女性自然写作作家. 而同为女性作家的Kathleen Jamie曾批评英国以前的自然写作都被Lone Enraptured Male占据了 “What’s that coming over the hill? A white, middle- class Englishman! A Lone Enraptured Male! From Cambridge! Here to boldly go, “discovering” , then quelling our harsh and lovely and sometimes difficult land with his civilised lyrical words.” 过于真实. 作者批评英国自然写作是都市文学, 作者和读者跟自然的关系更多是回忆和怀旧而不是日常鲜活的生活体验. 被“Lone Enraptured Male”中枪最终的无疑是麦克法兰. 麦克法兰右边还被吐槽“Macfarlish”, 通过赞扬别的作品使你自己的作品变得更好(不就是抱团嘛😂 文中还提到了一个我没听过名字的“Richard Mabey”, 写到他在很多不同的subgenre深厚得影响了创作. 比如他写过“Unofficial Countryside”让大家意识到了边缘地带, 还写过 《大不列颠花》( Flora Britannica (1996)), 2005出了相似的鸟类书籍. Nature Cure(2005) 写自己的精神疾病如何被自然治愈. 作者总结Mabey的作品是混合了文化、land practice、文学、科学、视觉艺术、雕塑和自然. 既是隐喻又根源于真实存在的事物. 而更近的作品, 自然和文化已经被景观和文学部分代替了.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://landlinesproject.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/the-rise-and-popularity-of-british-nature-writing-an-interview-with-pippa-marland-by-gunhild-riske/&#34;&gt;The rise and popularity of British Nature Writing: an interview with Pippa Marland by Gunhild Riske&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这篇文章开头先是总结了英国自然文学的几种类型, 回忆录、自然世界的治愈力量、对特定生物的热爱、对某个地方的热爱、和自然世界的互动(通常是农业)、环境主义观点、个人关于已灭绝物种的回忆, 还提到了女性和青年自然文学写作者. 采访者问英国自然文学这么流行是不是因为怀旧, 英国很早就工业化, 保留的自然很少. 被采访者认为不只是怀旧, 也有全球环保主义运动的兴起. 想到来爱尔兰之后, 通常每天都会去家附近的湖边散步, 拍过很多次鸽群, 风大的时候会注意到海鸥飞得特别欢, 海鸥不同季节的羽毛长得也不一样, 前段时间发现鹅生了小鹅仔. 有时走在路上会发现有只小鸟也在前面走, 走姿特别可爱. 正如Kathleen Jamie所说“between the laundry and fetching the kids from school, that&amp;rsquo;s how birds enter my life” 自然不仅是在荒野之境, 也是在我们身边. 后半部分讲自然写作如何把自然和社会历史, 在地和全球融合在一起, 还有人类如何看到昕的“人类世”(Anthropocene), 人类活动对地方的影响所开创的新的地质时代. 竟然还意外地提到了塞巴尔德的《土星之环》. 就人类世的观念和摄影里的新地形摄影(New Topographics)特别相似诶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25002982&#34;&gt;The Moth Snowstorm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读了中间那篇the great thining, 因为之前那篇why new nature writing so tame提到了. 读多了英国自然写作, 的确会以为英国自然保护非常好&amp;hellip; 所以知道英国在过去半个世纪野生动植物的数量衰退了一半还是很惊讶的, 主要是鸟类,野花和蝴蝶. 作者在书中认为最大的原因是农业. 二战后英国实行农业补贴政策 不管市场供求是多少, 政府都有个最低收购价. 所以对于农民来说, 最优的选择是尽力开荒种植和畜牧.作者把有些地称为”green concret“
在一段时间里, 大家都认为城市化对环境造成了破坏, 农民是自然的守护者. 后来才意识到农业对自然的破坏. 有段时间为了提高产量, 农药打得也特别多, 造成了昆虫、蜗牛、野花、杂草的死亡. 这些又使得鸟类失去了很多食物来源.以及有一段时间技术所限, 大家没有数据, 对于物种多样性衰退, 只有模糊的感觉“这个鸟好像还在, 只是好像没有以前那么多了. 它真的在发生吗? 还是只是我们想象的.” 1960年后, 才有一些野生动物观测计划来记录野花、鸟、蝴蝶的数量. 拿蝴蝶举例, 大约四分之三的蝴蝶品种在英国已经衰退或者是消失了. (时间段可能是二十世纪三十年代到二十世纪末)
作者在2000年前后意识到蛾很多不见了, 在他小时候, 如果夏天在路上走或者骑车, 必须闭上嘴, 不然肯定会有飞蛾飞进嘴里. 在五十年代从Norfolk开车去London, 路上要听三四次去清理挡风玻璃和车灯上的蛾. 但慢慢地, 蛾不见了. 根据2006的一个报告, 1968到2002之间, 英国337种蛾有三分之二数量在衰退, 80种减少了70%, 20种减少了90%. 注意到上周末徒步的路边都是羊, 路上都是羊粪, 但蛾还挺少的, 就见到了一次.
文章的最后是作者在伦敦找麻雀, 麻雀不太会迁徙, 如果一个小范围的麻雀数量减少了, 就代表他们真的没了. 作者先和朋友有一天特地去找麻雀, 先去了Borough Market附近, 没找到. 又去了南岸Gabriel’s Wharf的另一个教堂, 还是没找到. 接着他们穿过Waterloo Bridge去了West End,  在一个意大利餐馆附近遇见了三只麻雀. 作者说“I never imagined I would ever feel this way about sparrows.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>二零二一下半年总结</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_second_half/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 21:00:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_second_half/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-old&#34;&gt;1. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还是可以从现有的爱好里(跑步、徒步、书籍、音乐)获得快乐, 还挺珍惜这一点的. 现在会觉得快乐就是不可持续的, 能有能力体验到生活里微小的快乐就很好了.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;刚来爱尔兰那段时间, 对认识新的人还挺开放的. 最近发现会比较regularly发消息(一周联系一次)的朋友可能就五个, 只有J是来爱尔兰新认识的.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-new&#34;&gt;2. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前段时间跟DD聊到, 一晃眼就27了, 不是年龄焦虑, 是停下来想一想, 过了好多年, 但每一年都好难, 都有伤心的事, 而且越往后, 困难只会越多, 不会越少. 当然也会有开心的事, 但伤心的事会记更久.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近半年来感受和过去两三年最大的不同是变脆弱了, 比以前爱哭, 也过不了两三年前什么都不稳定的生活, 当然硬要扔在那个处境里, 还是可以handle的. 但换个角度说, 是以前根本不允许自己那么脆弱, 那时候最常出现的念头是“我不在乎”, 不是嘴硬说不在乎, 是不在乎就是不在乎, 根本没建立什么联系, 也没什么在乎的. 那段时间以为自己是完全体了hhh 现在有一定的安全感去在乎某些事, 某些人. 可能是已经经历过一些很难的事, 以前会觉得太脆弱发生了什么, 日子就过不下去了, 因为的确发生过. 现在稍微脆弱点, 即使伤心了, 还是能function normally. 韧性也变强了吧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;八月份开始全职工作了, 没有特别的感受, 目前挺有意思的, 有挑战性不无聊. 但对脑力的消耗也挺大, 体现在阅读上, 今年明显虚构作品远大于非虚构作品&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;七月底搬到都柏林, 离开了好不容易在科克交的朋友, J八月离开爱尔兰去了希腊, 好在D也来了爱尔兰, 虽然还没到交不了任何新朋友的状态, 但太需要老友了&amp;hellip; (可能下半年的主题是我需要别人.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来都柏林后还有个新习惯是做了好多饭, 在Cork主要还是做, 我喜欢, 离开了L我终于走上了独立自主的道路 完全不会因为host家宴紧张了, 甚至可以每两周就host家宴, 菜也不怎么重复&amp;hellip; 大多数菜只要有菜谱基本都不会失误. surprise myself&amp;hellip; 中间有段时间反思 在中国 潜意识里是抵触做饭的 会把做饭和照顾别人的女性期望联系到一起 想想人生的前25年主要力气花在和社会作斗争不干社会期望让我做的事&amp;hellip; 来爱尔兰之后力气主要花在跟自己对着干, 反思了很多之前没有想过自己的personality, 行为模式, 人际关系.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十月去土耳其待了十天, 比较开心的是走了Lycian Way, 看了Lycian遗迹, 想想历史长河, 就会觉得自己的一生毫不重要, 也就放宽心了(bushi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有一点新的感受, 年轻的时候觉得人跟人之间的关系, 靠思想交流就行了, 没必要身体接触 (这点可能是东亚习惯, 欧洲人和东亚人朋友间身体接触的尺度也挺不一样的) 近半年来体会到, 真的会不一样, 一对一的关系会更有安全感, 挺神奇的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下半年host了一个event, cohost了一个women in tech event. 在性别议题自我教育进步了不少.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;感谢一年来所有遇到过的,欢度过时光的人吧&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上半年总结提到了担心和某个好朋友的友谊, 八月初两个人就谈了谈, 做了closure, 有closure真好啊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下半年常在反思的事情是傲慢了, 我以前不觉得自己是个很傲慢的人, 或者说我的傲慢体现在“太自我”了. 比如说, 我不太能注意到别人的感受, 不是说我喜欢伤害别人, 而是我会觉得我的问题是我的问题, 别人的问题是别人的问题, 你要跟我说, 我能帮就帮, 但你的问题是你自己的问题. 我也没期待别人来关心我的问题. 希望可以在这方面进步一点, 有困难向别人求助, 也多在乎别人的问题.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;希望明年减少一些社交, 多一点时间给自己. 来爱尔兰一年, 太敞开了, keep saying yes. 结果是越来越频繁得感受到因见人太多导致的burnout. 一部分见人是为了找对象, 虽然得出来的结果还是我真的很难跟人合得来. 做朋友大家都挺好, 谈恋爱总有奇怪的事情发生&amp;hellip; 看了眼今年, 书没好好读, 照片没好好拍, 工作上也没有深入研究, 还是挺难受的.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>二零二一上半年总结</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_first_half/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 21:59:03 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_first_half/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;前几天在womenoverseas论坛里看到一个朋友分享的半年度总结用了something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue and a silver sixpence in her shoes来写生活中那些不变但是应该感谢的事, 新发生的事, 从别人身上获得的帮助, 悲伤的事以及对未来的展望. (ps和这个谚语的原本的指代有些不同), 借用来总结二零二一上半年.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-old&#34;&gt;1. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这半年来依然在我生活中的除了比较固定的习惯, 锻炼读书, 还有一些老朋友.比如周六要跟两个好友开半年度复盘总结会议, 苍蝇搓手&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我挺喜欢近几年的状态的&amp;hellip; 少担心睡眠好, 想做的事情就做了, 但另一个角度看, 这样的生活也很细碎, 拎不出一条脉络. 即使是兴趣爱好, 也是品类繁多, 时间精力投入全凭心情, 扔一边捡起来再扔一边. 没什么心理负担, 也少有attachment, 工作和交友的情况差不多相似&amp;hellip; 不过这种浮游的状态我也过了很多年, 习惯了&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;又给亲朋好友们安排了每年一度的杨梅, 该吃的人都吃到了.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-new&#34;&gt;2. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年或者是很长一段时间早上开始工作的时间比较晚, 加上中午午觉一两小时, 经常会工作到晚上九十点. 给身体造成了不大好的影响. 大约从三月中旬开始, 就设定了新的作息表, 早上九点开始工作到十二点, 下午两点开始工作到下午五点半, 之后就安排side project或者是social, 拍照, 锻炼. 最后发现该干的活也还是干完了&amp;hellip; 也没耽误完. 生活幸福感增加了不少.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从五月开始放弃了纸质planner, 开始用notion做weekly planner, weekly review, monthly review, 加上calendar, 发现效果不错&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五月的时候认识了Q姐姐, 终于开始在爱尔兰hiking! 至今去了Cork附近的两次海边, 还去了Tipperary, Waterford以及Kerry三个山, 两个是高山湖泊. 照片有发在IG. 除了徒步外, 还开始比之前频繁多的举铁和攀岩, 因为我上半身肌肉实在是太缺乏锻炼了&amp;hellip; 之前都是做力量瑜伽, 做这两种运动后统统变成拉伸瑜伽😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五月写了三篇British Nature Writing的&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/doulist/140143022/&#34;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; 也读了好几本相关的书, 之后有兴趣再回来看吧&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;六月开始在爱尔兰街拍, 开启了一个新摄影项目 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/irishpubstudy/&#34;&gt;#irishpubstudy&lt;/a&gt; , 五月还学会了如何用capture one修图&amp;hellip; 之前都是用手机软件修的. 还买了个新镜头&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first two experience of shooting on the Cork streets, I found I was drawn attention by pubs. Then, I do some research about it and decide to start a personal project about Irish pubs. Because it combines with lots of topics I’m interested, such as microhistory, cultural history, public space, third places, inter-personal communication and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Covid, lots of Irish drink outside, which is a new trend,. Traditionally Irish pubs are inside with small or no-windows and Irish don’t drink outside as often as Italians and Spanish, partly because the weather in Ireland is not lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二月份确定了全职工作,  五月份开始了实习, 主要是做一个open-source project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vKubeViewer/vkubeviewer&#34;&gt;vkubeviewer&lt;/a&gt; (实习到七月底, 全职八月初开始, 无份衔接), 而且虽然dev只有两个人, 但我是tech lead(不是), 所以还要定dev plan, 和mentor沟通, 和pm沟通. 学习到蛮多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;做菜技术提高了不少&amp;hellip; 举例, 我已经会做煎饺、寿司,、红烧鱼、红烧排骨、蒜烤鸡翅/排骨、羊肉烧烤, 独立搞一次家宴不成问题&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;跟人date超过两个月, 超过了之前的最长纪录. 我反思了下是这样的, 因为我不喜欢改变别人也不喜欢埋怨别人, 然后可能自己生活习惯太确定的, 经常会因为一些小地方感到不舒服, 但我会跳过沟通的环节, 直接finish&amp;hellip; 如果想拥有长期关系, 这点的确是需要改变一下. 不过比起一年前已经好太多了, 对进步感到满意, 觉得自己离long-term relationship只有一步之遥了&amp;hellip; 但对单身生活也感到快乐&amp;hellip; 还确定了自己可以结婚但不想生孩子(可能会变但目前的想法是这样)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有个是! 我参与了很多女性论坛, 比如说分享经验在豆瓣的women in tech小组, 还有womenoverseas论坛, 还参加了女性群体的social hour. 一年还是两年前比较认真的反思且被朋友们指出过我有些厌女. 现在可以共情很多以前不能共情的议题了. which i couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这半年里获得帮助最多的第一是我的mentor, 他人真的好好&amp;hellip; 我们这么一个简单和学校合作的实习项目, 只要他有空, 都会回答我的问题, 还有1:1, 还邀请很多人给我们career talk或者是interview. 还要感谢同学Epi, 从她身上也学习到很多跟人沟通合作的方式. 而且她安排我完全不用写论文, 只要写代码, 对此我太开心了&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;找工作期间联系了两个本科时的好朋友帮我mock interview (因为岗位一样) 有一个有一段时间没有联系了 对方已经成家生子还挺忙碌的 但还是热情地帮忙了 : ) 感谢&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还有要感谢的还是好友们了, 人生有一些志同道合的朋友还是很欣慰的, 虽然除了两个好友, 其他人日常都不联系, 但难得联系一次, 默契也都还在. 我到底是哪来的好运气&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上半年觉得爱尔兰天气还不错, 从三月中旬开始就有很多晴天, 下午结束工作会散步, 好像遇到雨天不是很多, 谢谢老天爷&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在科克认识的新朋友也很好, 生日那天朋友还特地给我做了三遍我爱喝的鸡尾酒, 还有芝士蛋糕(我是凌晨十一点半说的是我生日哈哈哈), 有的朋友带我hiking, 有的朋友带我认识新朋友, 有的朋友请我去家里吃饭, 大家都很好, 感恩的心&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;从五月份开始有只灰色母猫猫(白领斤+白手套)大约每周一次从后院翻墙来家里玩(蹭吃蹭喝)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我感觉到自己失去了一个好朋友&amp;hellip; 但我不太能理解到发生了什么, 我可能理解到发生了什么, 但理解不到对方为什么会因为发生的事情做了这样的决定, 然后我也不知道跟对方如何沟通&amp;hellip; emmm 但我目前好像是, 可以不解决的事情就先不解决&amp;hellip; 上一次发生类似的事情还是一六年&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前一段时间纠结过, 要不要工作几年跳到欧洲大陆, 后来做了一番研究, 决定就在爱尔兰待五年&amp;hellip; 所以长期计划是两年后换stamp4, 五年后考虑换身份的, 中间考虑买房&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺便做了一番不是很完善的提早退休计划&amp;hellip; 但计划过于模糊, 之后再谈😂 理想是四十岁吧&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;希望今年下半年或者明年年初能拿到驾照&amp;hellip; 我要hiking, 还有学好车等朋友来爱尔兰可以带他们去看鸟!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/step73/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The conversations happened in 2019, October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1、&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X&amp;quot;我喜欢的摄影师有两类 一类是强烈的个人风格 比如说森山大道 他拍的东西大家都能拍 他拍来拍去也是这些 但风格是他原创的 另一类是有生活 这里又分为两种 一种比如吕楠 对一个问题拍四五年 有深度 另一种是植田正治 强大的抽象能力和提炼能力 寇德卡在吕楠和植田正治中间&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;我没看过寇德卡&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;你手机现在查一查&amp;quot;
页面出来是这样的
J&amp;quot;哦 类似于卡帕那种&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;不是&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;你这说的是黑白啊 我都记不清多久没拍黑白了 这几年比较喜欢Stephen Shore和Martin Parr&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;色彩太难拍了 Shore在我心中比Martin厉害一点 Shore的照片能看出对色彩的掌控力 就是同样的素材换个摄影师 拍不出来&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;你觉得我现在拍的怎么样&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;马来西亚拍的比你平时好些 但看不到你的掌控力或者说对素材的处理 会想是不是素材本身比较好 换个摄影师可能也能拍得出来&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;比如说这张挺好的 但这几张这几张 太乱了 你根本就没处理&amp;rdquo;
J&amp;quot;那广西的那组呢&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;没看过&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;我现在用日记不用相册是考虑到主题和顺序&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;嗯 这也是我为什么不怎么发照片了 都是乱的 你广西的主题是什么呢&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;就过年出去玩拍的&amp;hellip; 可能主题就是春节&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;那你这两张跟这主题有什么关系呢 这三张 硬要说春节的旧货市场也行 但很牵强啊&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;嗯&amp;hellip; 但比以前是想着有个主题把它组织在一起&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;只能说你的组织形式非常不成熟&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2、&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;quot;上次跟你说我觉得单张作品没意义 根本立不住 你还反驳说单张照片有自己的意义 这次好像想法变了？&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;单张照片还是有自己的意义的 但是从传播的角度 以前传播是靠刊登在报纸和杂志上 容量低 现在互联网传播呈现的更全面 还有信息的爆炸 比如你有些好的照片 有个人告诉我是shore没发表的作品 放在摄影集里 我也判断不出来 但单张照片可以作为代表作被大众了解 比如说寇德卡 你对摄影师上的经典风格比较了解 刚看寇德卡就说有点像卡帕 但其实不是这样
就比如说诗歌 我们会说有些诗人是幸运地拥有代表作的 有些诗人是没有代表作的&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;前段时间读到首庞德的《地铁车站》太牛逼了&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;是啊 对于一般读者来说 说庞德就知道这首 除此以外就没有 大家知道张枣 因为他有首《镜中》 知道叶芝的《当你老了》 但对专业读者来说 叶芝的成就基本和这首诗无关&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;嗯 前段时间听一个播客聊到摄影为什么很难聊（例如比起电影） 相对于电影经典文本的易得性 获得摄影史的经典影集是有很高门槛的（贵） 也没有网络资源 很多非常著名的影集 大多数人能看到的也就是片面的几张 我是靠广州和成都的方所才翻到&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;我是靠图书馆&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;quot;感觉现在大家的感受比较单薄 （我拿了沈从文给张兆和写的信举例子&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;因为表达的即时性啊 比如以前我坐火车看到牦牛 想告诉女朋友 只能写信 我可能会晚上在旅店里给她写 描述牦牛是什么样的 旁边的风景是怎么样的 我心里的感受 周围人的反应 现在我只要拍张照片 微信发给她‘看！牦牛！’ 这个感受在观看的当下就到此为止了&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;所以即使是沈从文 到了现代 也会面临感受变单薄的问题？&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;是吧 毕竟这是受认知形式影响的&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X&amp;quot;我现在很少带相机出门了 但我还是喜欢看 拍决定性瞬间捕获感太强&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;我也是 以前上街手不离快门 现在相机就是荡在旁边 而且不喜欢太符号化的东西 让我再去拍老街 死也不拍 简直媚俗 所有太符号化太直白的东西都不拍 有时候看到一个画面 想想拍出来 应该也就那样 就不拍了&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5&#34;&gt;5.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;聊到陈以侃过于非中国
X&amp;quot;那你觉得我呢 我知道自己喜欢描写画面感的东西 是受唐朝诗歌还有中国古代画景的影响 但不了解我的人可能会觉得我整天在读西方诗歌 写的是现代诗 没有中国的东西 但我心里是清楚的&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;你知道我说的某些人是事实&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;是也是吧 那你觉得没有中国的东西有什么问题呢&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;不真实 因为中国的生活不是这样的&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;我觉得不真实不准确 但什么是中国东西呢 有些人觉得古诗里的东西当代生活也没有啊 比如说有些人喜欢用鹤啊松风啊白象啊这种意向 也很容易没人批评&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;这太符号化了 说不来 我想说的是一种气质和底子&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6&#34;&gt;6.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;聊到严明和张克纯 冬至认为张克纯比严明更丰富张在&amp;quot;造景&amp;quot;
我之前都是从地形摄影理解张克纯的 因为对造景想的并不多 虽然很早就很喜欢Jeff Wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7&#34;&gt;7.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;quot;我这次来上海不想拍 我是觉得很多东西对我的审美太丑了 我不喜欢&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;这样就不对了 你说这个东西美不美 是以鉴赏者的角度 但作为创作者来说 面对一个素材两种可能 1. 这个素材不是我喜欢的素材 2. 这个素材我想处理 但我处理不来&amp;quot;
当时我们站在南京西路还是东路对着路边行道树亮着的彩灯说
J&amp;quot;这个东西我曾经想处理过 最后拍了 但压根没处理&amp;quot;（
X&amp;quot;对啊 比如说彭可可能就喜欢处理这种素材 人家还能处理好&amp;quot;（谈话里给他推荐了彭可）
J&amp;quot;是啊&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;快分别了
J&amp;quot;谈不出问题&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;你想谈什么问题？&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;不知道 是我最近脑子没东西 就觉得大家默默都挺努力的 不然就被洗掉了&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;我四五年前参加一个诗歌会 现在参会的人 没几个还在写诗的啦 一年写十几首 很不容易了 你几几年的&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;94&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;25岁是个分水岭 如果因为厌倦 你现在已经有厌倦的情绪了 再过几年 摄影对你就是怀念青春的纪念了&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;你们写诗只要在家坐着就行了 我还得出去&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;这是艺术形式决定的 摄影的艺术形式就决定你要出去 不是我在家坐着就比较舒服&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;你不能悠哉悠哉等着创作热情的到来 要给自己定任务 比如我对宋朝诗歌不了解 这个月就读宋朝诗歌 每天读 读一个月 你对灯光感兴趣 结果就只拍了一张 也没处理 你就定这个月拍灯光&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;我不喜欢这么直白的语言&amp;quot;
X&amp;quot;灯光也有很多种啊 路边的灯光 商场里的灯光 反光的灯光 要给自己定任务 多拍点 豆瓣多发发&amp;quot;
J&amp;quot;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>二零二零阅读总结</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_reading/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 22:08:32 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_reading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;截止2020.12.29日, 今年至今读了111本书, 其中24本是漫画, 12本小说, 今年读书是最没有系统性的, 除了年初读了几本疫情相关的书, 都是看到啥感兴趣就读啥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先来说今年第一次读到且喜爱的新作家:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《佩德罗·巴拉莫》《燃烧的原野》胡安·鲁尔福
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;更喜欢《佩德罗·巴拉莫》, 带给我的冲击相当于福克纳的《我在弥留之际》, 最喜欢的点是对话人物的转换 (超越福克纳的地方) 有种莫比乌斯环的感觉, 福克纳、略萨的对话人物还是比较容易辨别和直线结构的, 鲁尔福有种反复螺旋的结构. 读到后面拼起来之后会感觉前面的信息还有些留在脑子里. 《燃烧的原野》更多是地域气质…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《青春》《耻》 库切
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;买了库切的10年后终于读了库切，《青春》是中二失意文艺青年心灵鸡汤, 但朋友说“库切31岁就在异国工作了5年，还读了博士，当了教授”！ 其实库切的书读起来不是快感, 很多时候甚至很不舒服. 《耻》读体验比较矛盾 前半部分看卢里就典型中年自恋狂男性 借用前妻的话“你以为一个年轻姑娘同这把年纪的人上床会有什么快感？你以为她会看着你那样会有什么样的好感” 现实世界里太多了… 后面又为他面对女儿遭遇的事以及女儿的决定郁闷. 但这种复杂又矛盾又真实的处境被库切写出来了啊!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《超越极限》《羅蘋計畫》《第三时效》 横山秀夫
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;今年最喜欢的 推理作家.《第三时效》是短篇小说集, 侦探是警察, 略微有种陈浩基的感觉. 《超越极限》比起推理小说, 更是以真实事件为背景的纪实文学. 主人公是一位地方报纸编辑部的中层编辑, 事件是当时本地发生了520人死亡的灾难, 在报道的过程中暴露出报社各种利益斗争（广告刊登 灾难组和其他内容编辑的竞争 外部的政治因素（日本有选举), 还有本人的家庭问题（经济 子女关系 上一辈的问题）, 很多内容会让我联想到此次的疫情报道, 另外书中涉及登山的内容加上漫画《神之山岭》, 日本的登山文化还挺浓厚的.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《离岸》《蓝花》 佩内洛普·菲茨杰拉德
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《离岸》有种奇妙的混沌感… pivot一直在变的感觉 就可能某种程度算群像小说 但群像小说可能是视角更高看整体 《离岸》这本有点换人物镜头一下子切的很近 有点想到《地球之夜》结尾觉得莫里斯自杀而不是爱德华跑来跟莫里斯喝酒两个人都遇难……更好. 《蓝花》很有特点, 但不对我的口味.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《龙》村上紀香
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;目前读到第16卷, 是以上世纪中日战争满洲国为背景的历史漫画, 主角是学习武术(主要是剑道)的中日混血, 想更多了解满洲国的历史.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《你的夏天还好吗？》 金爱烂
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;第一个记住的韩国作家… 上一次看到这种笔力的短篇是门罗，但两者的出戏感也相近，第一人称视角，时常涌起“这种背景的角色有如此的感知力吗？” 每篇后面的社会议题：从拆迁到洪灾到劳动保障到传销，处理的都不错. 最喜欢“那里是夜，这里有歌” “角质层” “虫子”
-《解说疾病的人》 裘帕·拉希莉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;每篇都与印度、孟加拉、巴基斯坦有关，但的确是写得好的对“故国”的哀愁，混杂了日常生活的困境。 Spoiler alert 《停电时分》里丈夫发现和流产的妻子愈发疏离 停电期间妻子跟他玩“每天说一件没告诉对方的事” 以为是两人和好的前兆 没想到妻子是为了几天后说出“我要搬出去了 已经付了房租” 《解说疾病的人》里导游幻想和美国来的印度裔主妇的浪漫关系 没想到对方是为了吐露自己出轨的秘密虽是女性作者 似乎更喜欢拿男性做第一视角 讲印度分裂的《柏哲达先生来搭伙》视角是孩子，父母还有柏哲达都是来自孟加拉地区的印度人，当冲突爆发时，三人即使离开故土，但依旧关心着动态。“那段时间里，他们三个大人行动起来像一个人，同吃一顿饭，同一个身体，同一种沉默，同一种忧虑” 像一二月许多中国人。但不确定会不会再去读这个作者的书…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《帝国游戏》罗贝托·波拉尼奥
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;飞机上读的… 当时没有写书评, 有些忘记了. 之前尝试过读波拉尼奥, 每本都读不下去…- - 这本早年的小说还是比较好读. 虽然是智利作者, 但主角都是德国人, 地点是西班牙旅游小镇. (联想到《象棋的故事》, 德国人是不是很喜欢棋类游戏) 最神秘和有吸引力的人物当然是克疤多. 迷幻眩晕的氛围塑造的挺好的…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有几本值得推荐的书:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《逃避统治的艺术 : 东南亚高地的无政府主义历史》詹姆士·斯科特
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对云南游启发最大的一本书. 本书里的区域更广泛, 大致是中国和缅甸、泰国、老挝、越南边界. 祛除了所谓高贵的野蛮人的迷思，野蛮人或许并非是和文明社会截然不同的物种，而是在前现代社会中，由于国家代表着强制的税收和劳役，选择了迁徙到高地，没有文字，用口述历史来灵活地改变民族认同，更平等的社会阶层。据说云南边境前几年还有那些选择住在山里没有身份证的山民。现在许多从发达国家到东南亚或边缘国家住的嬉皮，也是行使同样逃避“现代资本主义和国家制度”统治的艺术啊。（以前只从汇率价格、收入差异、签证易得性考虑这个问题）E.J.Hobsbawm“你甚至可以说那些具有强烈和持久部落族群观念的人不仅仅是抗拒现代国家强加的统治，不管是民族国家还是其他形式，而且针对任何国家。”国境线是现代才有的事物，以前边境是模糊的，存在许多国家统治外的生活。各地的文化多有意思啊, 不需要放在国家的框架理解.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《我的探险生涯》斯文·赫定
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;斯文赫定的这两本游记都很有意思. 从他在瑞典读书写到中亚再到多次到中国, 发现罗布泊, 去西藏. 中文wiki里有兩則比較有意思的信息「在获得博士学位，学习了多种语言和方言以及两次穿过伊朗的旅程之后，他没有听从老师的建议继续学习以通晓地理学研究方法。结果，后来他不得不将他的探险收获交给其他科学家进行评估」和「赫定深爱着一名叫米莉的女子。长期的单相思让他终身未婚，因而无嗣。」（雲南那個洛克也終身未婚⋯⋯）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《说吧，叙利亚》 阿加莎·克里斯蒂
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;阿婆的游记, 非常有趣, 跟随第二任丈夫考古学家在叙利亚考古挖掘, 轻松读物, 阿加莎一惯的幽默. 写了阿拉伯人、库尔德人、阿美尼亚人,看完觉得库尔德人好有意思. 当时考古队和叙利亚政府是这么划分文物的, 英方考古学家把文物分为两堆, 让叙利亚官员选喜欢哪堆, 所以要分的比较平衡. XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《Dreams of Leaving and Remaining》
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;英国退欧前以四个城市为代表英国的渔业、农业、医疗以及工业。读本书之前，对英国脱欧的理解的确浮在受教育水平高的精英拥抱全球化，教育水平低的英国“红脖”（不知道对应的英国词是啥）反对全球化。全书最有意思的是农业，英国农民/农场主很大一部分收入是靠补贴的，不补贴的话每年的收成养不活自己。就很容易会觉得这种补贴政策是不好的，不如去海外进口更便宜的粮食。近代农业技术发展后，生产效率大幅提高，但农业的发展是以自然景观的破坏为代价，环境保护主义者反对农民对土地的开垦，补贴 not for farming, but for not farming，补贴里很重要的一部分是管理农场。比如说你两块田中间要隔多少距离，给花花草草和昆虫留下空间，农场里要养多少只云雀，如果没有达成就不能收到占补贴很大比例的“管理”补贴。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《中国国家治理的制度逻辑 : 一个组织学研究》 周雪光
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;因为疫情中各种乱象读的, 主要理论框架：一统体制与有效治理之间的矛盾。还有引入韦伯的官僚制度和合法性，我国的合法性要求征集，而不是法理性的（与中央权力至高无上相违背） 两个维系机制——官僚体制和一统观念制度（所谓的政治教化的礼仪化）以及为了适应一统和有效治理矛盾产生的运动型治理机制。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《扬州园林》 陈从周
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果有兴趣去扬州玩必读! 我是旅游前临时抱佛脚读的… 了解到扬州园林最大的特点是利用高低起伏变化扩展空间(本身地方小) 推荐何园、逸圃的、瘦西湖和小盘谷.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《鼠疫斗士 : 伍连德自述(上)》
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;讲述马来西亚华侨伍连德控制住二十世纪初东北鼠疫的故事.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《天生有罪 : 特雷弗·诺亚的变色人生》 特雷弗·诺亚
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;很有趣的一本自传, 很好读. 如果对南非种族隔离制度感兴趣, 有色人种带来带来不同的视角. 之前读过的尼日利亚作家阿迪奇写的黑人身份认同, 南非有色人种的文化建构更为复杂.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>二零贰零小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 21:40:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二零二零年是特别忙碌和收获很大的一年, 感恩的心.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;self&#34;&gt;Self&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近几年算持续困扰自己的问题是时常感到和过去自己的陌生感和过去生活的割裂感. 我对生活的掌握和稳定感来自有意识地保持一致性, 和老朋友保持联系, 定义明确的三观和行为准则. 但上一次大更新应该是16年, 而这几年间我的变化已经大到我需要曲解一些现实来匹配我的认知. 不过现在到了可以接受变化和更新的时间点了, 蛮开心的.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;friends&#34;&gt;Friends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前段时间看到邹思聪的微博讲Cummings的一首诗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;直到他看着街边的一棵树，风吹着飘下了一片片的叶子，他跟我说，你知道E.E.Cummings吗？达达主义诗人。没等我回答，他拿出手机，给我看了一首诗，然后解释了起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l(a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;le&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;af&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iness]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他说你看，括号里面，是“一 片   树   叶   掉   下 来   了”，括号外面的字母，合起来就是“孤独”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他指着那些掉下来的叶子，你看叶子是怎么掉下来的，它们随风掉下来的时候，东摇西摆的，一片片的，无所依托的。这首诗重要的不是韵律，而是它的结构，你看这首诗里所有的字母，都被吹散了，摇摇晃晃，和现实一样，树叶就是这么掉下来的，它们都是化成一个个孤零零的字母，你看那个a，从上往下，划过的弧线，就是我们眼前的这片叶子，然后构成了整体的孤独。这就是Cummings的魅力，这就是我们的人生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先我承认人生就是很飘摇的,心灵整体的确是孤独的, 但不代表你不能再加一个括号, 外面是很多爱(心灵鸡汤上线&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l[l(a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;le&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;af&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iness]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020年我非常感谢几位朋友.
一月去扬州是和A同去的, 如果不是A, 我可能不会去扬州, 去了也不会关注腊梅啊, 园林植物啊, 园林设计啊. 谢谢她带给我新的视角. A也是对我诚恳地提出建设性批评意见最多的人, 虽然我没立刻改正, 但对很多事的态度从极端转向了相对温和.
B在短短几次见面后接纳我去她家吃饭和借宿, 感受到不是出于频繁交往而是出于互相欣赏的信任和友谊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果说我早年的人际交往更多是对世界好奇的探索, 明面上很开放但对亲密的朋友有点疏离, 现在是对几个朋友可以敞开的状态.(也不要太敞开了, 成年人了还是要有尺寸感的).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;world&#34;&gt;World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总的来说, 比起逻辑我更依靠直觉, 很多事情的学习和体验更多是突发性和事后回顾的, 学习也经常没有体系, 也不爱做笔记, 喜欢输入很多信息量, 然后看在脑子里能发现什么连接. 对自己的期望是, 保持humble, 记得没有人是全知全能的, 在缺乏足够信息时少下判断, 在信息违背原先判断时承认错误, 修改判断.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;covid&#34;&gt;Covid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于全世界, 2020最大的是疫情. 上半年我的生活也受疫情影响很多, 更新了几篇相关日志, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc2/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202003_summary/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事3&lt;/a&gt;, 就不赘述. 之后国内疫情缓和, 但九月在瑞丽旅游遭遇封城, 差点没赶上来爱尔兰的飞机, 也因此错失了和友人在上海的聚会, 实在是一大遗憾.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hiking&#34;&gt;Hiking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年最大的爱好是徒步,爵士乐已经沦为去年最爱😂 上半年主要是爬临海周边的山加看视频. 参见这篇博客&lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hiking/&#34;&gt;徒步全家桶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;八九月玉龙雪山hike两次, 雨崩hike四条线. 连着四天, 每天徒步6+小时, 路线10k+, 海拔爬上500-1000m, 下山泡脚休息一晚上第二天继续上山. 爽爆了😊😊😊😊😊
大自然带来的震撼真的无法用语言描述(如果语文不好&amp;hellip;)
什么时候能去尼泊尔和阿尔卑斯,任何一个都行 :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;locality&#34;&gt;Locality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年拜访了扬州、景德镇、婺源特别是云南, 加上近两年在故乡的生活. 改变了我的身份认同. 这篇博客略微相关 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_08_repo/&#34;&gt;飞鸿踏雪泥&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前如果硬要选一个和地域相关的身份认同, 比起中国人我更偏好世界公民, 但如今更偏好浙南人, 最好具体到括苍山雁荡山区域. 这并非说我狭隘了, 按朋友的话讲, 我十分流畅地适应了爱尔兰的社交生活. 而是我既不想用一个国家的政治实体作为我的身份认同, 也不想用一个想象的虚拟实体. 自认为浙南人, 是这里的食物和风土构成了我的底色. 不要困在国籍里, 和具体的附近建立联系.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-in-cork&#34;&gt;Life in Cork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来科克三个月, 感受: 我太适合这里的生活了&amp;hellip; 在国内我喜欢临海的生活节奏但找不到聊得来的朋友. 在上海可以找到朋友但我不喜欢在那里生活. 来科克发现这里人兴趣爱好广泛, 可能因为有音乐学院, 音乐爱好者好多.
好久没有讨论消费主义, 中产阶级生活方式、自我叙事了&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hobby&#34;&gt;Hobby&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年总共听了一两百张专辑, 说一些特别喜欢的, 去年两月份写过一篇 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202001_02_ablums/&#34;&gt;一二月刷砖小记&lt;/a&gt; 这里就只列三月之后的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadro Nuevo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我真的很难相信这个充满了拉美气息的乐队是德国的(德国人在我印象里的确只是酸泡菜Krautrock😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mammal Hands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;偶然间听到这个乐队, 之后跟着听了一批当代英国爵士, GoGo Penguin, Yussef Kamaal, The Comet is Coming, Matthew Halsall, 都很好听, 最喜欢的一首首Boreal Forest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stone Roses

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augustus Pablo

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们这个时代，认为需要承担历史责任的个人，三件事是逃不开的：香港、新疆、以疫情为代表的大陆问题。包括：对这些事件的了解、态度和行动上的选择。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二零二零年如同按了加速键，或者误入时空跳跃的传送门，转眼就八月下旬了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年短暂拜访广州、扬州、江西景德镇及婺源、云南昆明大理丽江、福建泉州及厦门、潮州。时常会感怀于各地丰富的历史和文化，也会因当代生活的同质化泛起难言的忧愁。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回想一六年第一次去泉州，惊喜于发现在江南和北方之外的中国，惊讶于泉州与东南亚、中亚乃至欧洲地区有那么多的交流，沉浸于多元文化的历史想象中，甚至写了首诗（……）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;「漫步太平洋西岸的海港&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想象中的街道 穿梭著波斯人、雅利安人、歐羅巴人和華夏人的臉龐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;揚帆的海風和緬桂的蜜香後是婆娑的菩提葉和燃燒的鳳凰花&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五月城牆下未開的五代的刺桐樹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;走過千年前信徒走過的神殿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;佛垂目靜坐 翼飛天演奏著喜樂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他們知道&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;心沒有去處時 多了一點傷心&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;墓碑石上書「此處埋葬著安德烈·佩魯賈，聖方濟各會士」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我似遠方而來走向你」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一七一八年都去过，今年再去，依然是熟悉的城市，但清醒得意识到不管是武汉、成都还是泉州，我心向之的古代城市，都经历了公共空间和意识形态控制的管理从民间地方社会团体转移到国家机关的过程。历史的面目是被人操纵的，民间习俗/文物古迹在明清被用作宣传官方正统思想的工具，在民国和共和国初期是需要破除的封建迷信，在当下是与资本主义结合的“地方特色旅游资源”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年或许是疫情，健康码、各类标语，加上从去年开始的各类街道整修，感觉到那种可能性只是存在你脑海里的历史想象，它回不来了，泉州逐渐塌陷成一座“普通”的中国城市。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也明白为什么自己偏好有河有海的城市，江海边日晚，都是天然的公共空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于为什么云南拥有中国少有的嬉皮社群，中国好山好水的地方不少，但东南沿海以及中部地区，汉文化圈力量太大。而云南自古以来和东南亚极其相似，民族和文化多样。这也是为啥东南亚是亚洲国际嬉皮社群最多的地区，当然物价、收入差异、签证易得性也是影响因素。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们这个时代，认为需要承担历史责任的个人，三件事是逃不开的：香港、新疆、以疫情为代表的大陆问题。包括：对这些事件的了解、态度和行动。我做出了选择。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年见了不少老朋友和新朋友，算是人生中最keep in touch with cloes friends的一年。在巨大的悲剧前，需要互相支持和鼓励吧，也更理解大家做的选择和背后的代价和挣扎。但也有对认识七八年的朋友的了解不如刚认识的人深的，坦诚地沟通最重要吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外，我们这个时代没有时代精神（像是存在主义或者马克思主义思潮），利弊都有，利是大家有更多选择的自由和发展的方向，弊是就我知道的同辈，很少有人拥有信念，人生的目标，一定要实现的梦想或者等等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近些年算是越来越脱节，没跟上各类短视频、综艺、游戏的步伐，到了相关话题听不懂的地步。（其实游戏也想玩的）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就当瞎说，保持严肃是抵抗。（朋友：你难道不是个喜剧人？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;终于又可以拿起相机了，摄影对我还是观察世界后的表达，关注点转向具体的事件和问题。并非决然弃掷宏大叙事。而是对主流话语单一的叙事的反抗，通过展现事物的复杂性和特殊性，来驳斥或证伪。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阿迪契 “书写社会现实并不一定非要写激烈地反抗社会不公，一个写作者更应该认清他小说中的角色生活其中的社会与政治空间。当你写一个爱情故事，我想看到的不是海誓山盟宏大叙事，而是他们如何付房租、他们的薪水够不够养活孩子。现实主义必须意识到，社会和政治议题就在无数细节之中。”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>徒步全家桶</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hiking/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:12:07 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hiking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;近日在读约翰·缪尔的《墨西哥湾千里徒步行》，约翰在1986年从印第安纳州的印第安纳波利斯走到佛罗里达州，最终到达墨西哥湾之后去了古巴。非常薄的小书，写法有些像航海日志，“九月二十一日。绚丽的森林！许多小溪穿流于道路间。我上午经过的布莱尔斯威尔似乎是个不规则而且没有什么重要性的小村落。但这村落被一串山丘包围，倒是显得气象宏伟。晚上被一位热诚的农夫招待留宿，他的妻子虽然外表敏捷整齐，但抽烟成癖。九月二十二日……” 偶尔几天有事发生才多写点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还在追YouTube上的Kraig Adams，美国独立摄影师，他在youtube上更新视频有几年了，但获得很多关注是近期发布的独自登山独步的视频，包括香港的麦理浩径(60milse)，尼泊尔的Mardi Himal Trail(25miles)，爱尔兰的Hornstrandir(60miles)，勃朗峰（120miles）。一开始质疑hiking alone?后来发现人家不仅带了sony a3还带了无人机，相机拍完爬上去的片段再回来取相机。几乎没有对话，优美但没有存在感的背景音乐，除了景色外，还拍了不少搭帐篷，铺睡袋，吃方便面，喝速溶咖啡，脱鞋子过河，晒袜子的片段。（第一次看到速溶咖啡的时候，我的内心“这也要拍”哈哈哈哈）但没有任何孤独的感觉，就是简单，平静，自在。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比起《活山》（不是说此书不好，很多朋友都很推荐）更能接受约翰·缪尔和Kraig Adams的作品的原因是个人差异（废话）。没有那么多观察，那么多感受，especially no spoken words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从去年秋天开始，差不多一周去山里徒步一次。能不走回头路就不走回头路，尽量走环线，保持均速，直上直下，偶尔停下来喝口水。上山时还会注意些风景，偶尔停下来拍拍照，下山时带着帽子路况好一溜小跑下来。日常喜欢10km左右 600m海拔上下的路线。
行走有没有意义和跑步有没有意义和人生有没有意义都不是好问题。有没有意义也无所谓，应该说是我需要行走消耗精力保持平静。爬山时，只背个轻便的帆布双肩包，放一瓶水，脖子上挂个相机，牛仔裤休闲裤都可以，随便穿一双运动鞋。就是一种需要很少的感觉。需要的的确很少。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;补充说说旅行文学，旅行文学是一种没有明确边界的概念。近些年最喜欢的游记是Robert Fortune的《两访中国茶乡》，但Robert进行其中的旅行时并非出于旅行的目的，而是作为植物猎人在中国寻找可移植到印度的茶树品种。契诃夫的《萨哈林旅行记》叫做旅行记，但更像是人类学社会学调查报告。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前在豆瓣上看到用户黎戈说：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;游记其实是一种蛮难写的文体，很容易写成手帐体和旅游指南。好看的印象中有这么几种：一，小说家写的，村上春树、梨木香步、西西、陈丹燕等等，小说家的情节构造训练做得多，能把普通人情景色写出故事感，有的写着写着就开始飘飞在想象中了，这个和现实的偏差其实恰是有趣的部分，可以读出作者的脑力和人心；二，摄影师写的，星野道夫、藤原新也，他们有视觉敏感度和人文解读力；三，建筑师写的，伊东丰雄、安藤忠雄等等，他们的空间理解力好。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读过村上，星野道夫，安藤忠雄，只有村上的觉得可以。个人意见是，有些人适合用文字表达，有些人适合用图像表达，不要对摄影师的文字有太多期望😂 但我很喜欢和小说家还有摄影师聊天，真的是享受。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就我个人而言，旅行前除却工具性的目的，不太会看任何当代的游记（这里需要指出我对取不同的地方过同样生活方式的旅行的偏见），更偏好于十几年前甚至历史上行者的游记，或者是相关的社会历史研究著作。也没有专门去读旅行文学，推荐几本喜欢的。村上春树的游记写的不错，最喜欢写希腊和意大利的《远方的鼓声》，艾芜写西南山区到缅甸的《南行记》，舒国治的《门外汉的京都》，劳伦斯写意大利的《Twilight in Italy》，傅真写东南亚的《泛若不系之舟》。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Women on the move</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/women_on_the_move/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 20:14:47 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;​		忘了具体是14年还是17年购于某个博物馆还是美术馆在纪念品商店，很小众的topic，作者是两个美国Connecticut College的教授（男性）以及越南国立大学的讲师（女性）研究的是河内周边农村来河内做街头小贩的女性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        这个现象的产生涉及城市人口的食物需求和农村劳动力来到城市提供服务。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        对于城市人口，获得食物有两大主要来源，其一是以超市和小商店为代表的正式现代网络，其二是街头小摊贩为代表的非正式网络。现代化进程提高了城市人口的消费需求，城市人口可以负担比原先更多的外出就餐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        随着人口增多，土地增量无法满足乡村人口的土地需求。单纯务农无法维持农村生活，对许多研究对象而言，离开它们的故乡，去城市摆摊，弥补匮乏的农业收入是他们可以保有乡村生活的唯一方法。另一方面，农村劳动力由于缺少教育和技能培训，很难在正式部门（如政府部门或者企业）找到稳定的工作，只能从事城市人通常不会选择的工作。1986年越南借鉴中国改革开放实施的doi moi运动，允许个体经济存在，自此个体在街头摆摊的行为才在法律上拥有合法性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        书中吸引我注意的是关于street vendors的日常生活描写：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        她们通常住在蔬菜水果批发市场附近，凌晨2到3点起床，去市场里备货，背着超过35kg的货物一天平均走10km，知道傍晚四五点，还要注意不被警察和小偷。居住环境通常是10个人一个房间的通铺，甚至有20个人一个房间的现象。有些房东会限制开电风扇的时间，即使在夏天；有些会定每日限额用水，所以有些只能在白天工作时在街上的公共厕所大便。（拥有排泄的自由是基本人权！）10%的人选择不吃早饭，午饭和晚饭偶尔才有鱼肉、猪肉或者肉汤，通常只是一个鸡蛋或者豆腐。虽然白天工作很辛苦，但最难熬的时刻是夜晚思念故乡和家人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        如今，我真的是很难正视有些人还过着这样的生活。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        她们来到河内，因为如果没有这部分收入，就无法满足乡村生活的现金需求，包括建造或者修缮房子的钱，孩子未来的教育费用，彩礼，亲戚生病需要给的红包（可以参考阎云翔的《礼物的流动》，越南果真受中国影响很深，几乎一模一样），有些人是家庭陷入负债后来到河内。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        在中国，男性比起女性拥有更多的外出务工机会，公众号鳞翅目海盗里有篇关于性别不平等的文章中写到“农村女性所遭遇的职场歧视，是她们永远在捡男性剩下的工作。现在的建筑行业、装修、长途运输等行业里，女性工作者的身影并不鲜见，但这并不是因为农村女性意识觉醒，而是因为男性劳力涌入了钱更多，活儿更轻松的行业，比如快递。”而在越南，是女性而不是男性外出务工，书中把最大的原因归结于乡村习俗，让我回想起在越南会安的菜场，所有的摊主，包括蔬菜肉禽，全是女性，没有一个男性… 而在街头local的咖啡馆里，全是男性，少有的女性都是游客…第二个原因是男性通常可以在家乡附近找到工作，比如专场，搬运工，或者建筑工人。第三个原因是越南人认为男性比女性能更严格地要求小孩，使他们认真学习（？？？）最后，女性比男性更会存钱而不是消费在自己身上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        还是那篇公众号同一篇文章提到，当男性外出务工时，“农村女性，那时候则在家带孩子、种田，因为承担了男劳力外出务工的缺口，反而比以前负担重。”越南的情况是，即使女性外出务工，男性也不做家务，通常是比较大的孩子或者是爷爷奶奶承担了这部分的责任。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        前段时间看了部新加坡导演陈哲艺的长篇处女作电影——《爸妈不在家》，讲新加坡一怀孕的母亲无力平衡工作、照顾小学的儿子，雇佣了一位菲律宾女性泰莉来家里做住家女佣照顾儿子和做家务，泰莉只能在工作间隙给在菲律宾的亲人打电话，请求他们照顾自己的孩子。这让我联想到几年前读的台湾社会学研究者蓝佩嘉的《跨国灰姑娘 : 当东南亚帮佣遇上台湾新富家庭》，当时第一次接触住家女佣的概念，还了解到东南亚帮佣不仅广泛存在于香港、台湾、新加坡，还有中东阿拉伯国家（特别是阿联酋）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        书里的female vendors，多是河内周边农村的人口，很大部分，每年会回家三四月，甚至有些是当日来回。而在中国，更普遍的情况或许是外出打工的父母亲，无法把孩子带在身边，由于中国幅员辽阔，每年只能过年时候回家。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        所有这一切都可以归在人口流动这个问题，细分下来是低端劳动力流动，女性劳动力流动，本国劳动力流动，全球劳动力流动。specific一些，女性因为她是女性甚至母亲，拥有了做一些工作的机会，但这个工作又剥夺了她自身作为母亲的机会。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​        有时候会想，人们为什么会远离故乡，去新的城市，新的国家，有的人是憧憬新生活，有的人是global elite，有的人是被迫迁移谋生。研究开始于2000年（成书于2013年），至今已过20年。这么多年里，一批又一批的女性来到河内成了street vendors。这么多年后，河内政府试着减少甚至消除街头摆摊的轻微，为了更加现代化的城市景观；河内的生活成本越来越高，需要的初始资金和承担的风险越来越大。上次去越南已是16年，或许她们会遇到越来越多的困难，甚至于成为street vendors不再是一个可以选择的选择。我能希望的是，随着经济结构的变化，有其他职业替代street vendors，给那些无力维持现有生活的人一个努力工作，获得更好生活的途径。&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在梅洛—庞蒂看来，后笛卡尔时代的哲学在身体和心灵之间划上了错误的分界线。终其职业生涯，他都主张感官知觉在我们对世界的理解，以及我们对世界的感知中，发挥着基础性作用。他认为知识是“通过感觉获得的”，身体在意识之前，已经拥有其独特的思考和理解方式。意识、肉体和现象世界密不可分地交织在一起。肉体使我们的主观意识“具象化”，我们因此“嵌入”了世界的肌肤。他将这种嵌入式的经验描述为“手中的知识”；我们的身体帮我们“抓住”世界，是“我们拥有世界的普遍媒介”。因此，世界本身不是自然科学所呈现的不变对象，而是无止境的关系之网。它只有在各种视角里才能呈现，而我们之所以能看见它，依靠的正是我们的身体及其感官功能。我们与世界同在，反之亦然，但我们永远只能看到它的部分面貌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再次引用《活山》娜恩·谢沷德 转引自张君钢的&lt;a href=&#34;https://douc.cc/2KQowK&#34;&gt;《马纳斯鲁大环线徒步旅行 》&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;平静的三月，除却日常工作以及日常书影音娱乐生活，  上了三次山，去了趟东来家吃饭，有二十五天在锻炼，七天在大吃大喝（并没有胖！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;说说几个新变化：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三月进了三次山，每次都是10km开外，许多快乐是山水和花花草草带来的，现在习惯是拍完小花花让桑桑看图识花^ ^ 每周尽量安排一次爬山，天气好会去江边骑车或者逛东湖，去东来家吃完饭第二天，起来去旅店门口的康健园散步。现在已经大致有概念梅花开完开玉兰，之后香樟长新叶子，桃花樱花次第。而大学四年在杭州，对气候的感知差不多局限在“夏天好热，冬天下雪可以去西湖走走，但经常有霾不能跑步。” 我“还挺神奇的发生这样的变化”东来“就是年纪大了&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近一两年应该是我成年后（也有十年了）身心最健康的时期。三月跑了七次步（50km都没到），但平均配速是5&#39;27&#39;，记得当年看大家发的配速6&amp;rsquo;都“woah😯” 年纪大了的又一表现，更注重自己的身体。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年某次和朋友讨论腰不适时想到，即使可以分部位训练，身体更多要从整体看，腰不仅仅是腰的问题，坐着这一简单动作涉及腰椎腰部肌肉背部肌肉甚至还有颈椎。跑步除了心肺，还要核心去维持身体的稳定（核心一泄气就塌了我就无法维持5‘的配速），臀肌带动腿部，腿部力量不够步距和步频都上不去。所以现在跑步热身除了下半身还做核心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个月新开始练shaun的T25第三阶段，主要练RIP&amp;rsquo;T UP、UPPER FOCUS、THE PYRAMID、DYNAMIC CORE和上半身相关的无氧运动，有氧用跑步和爬山替代，这系列的训练还挺推荐的，每次25min，容易坚持又有一定训练量，我的背终于开始厚了起来&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有做一些改善形体的训练，我膝超伸一直挺明显，注意拉伸也没什么改善，还是整体的问题，其他部分行走应该用到的肌肉不够强壮，用不正确部位的肌肉代偿。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;emmm&amp;hellip; 总体上对服饰还是没什么热情，对形体比较有热情😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前段时间读了本横山秀夫的《超越极限》，故事背景是1985年日本航空123号班机空难，波音747在日本群马县高天原山坠毁，死亡人数520人，仅有4人幸存，是世界上单一飞机死伤人数最多的空难事件。主角悠木和雅是地方报纸《北关东新闻》总社的老记者，被任命为日航报道全权负责人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整本读完，最大的感觉是憋屈，悠木和雅需要在编辑部里争夺更多的版面、头版头条，无法登手下记者冒着生命危险写的现场报道，没有抢先刊登正确的事故原因。需要和总务处、销售部以及出版社对抗，周旋于总经理和社长的内部派系斗争。他认为重要的事件，广告部认为广告费更重要，编辑部认为要报道竞选，和政治家搞好关系更重要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“办公室里安静得很，“世界最大的空难”好像只存在于电视机播放的画面里。不只是粕谷等报社的干部，连悠木和雅也都还没有对这次空难，有什么切肤之感。不到现场去就是不行。虽然沿关越高速公路，开车两个小时就能够赶到，但是，现在御巢鹰山，已经不是可以用距离和时间测量的，而是一个相当遥远的存在。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;或许人面对灾难的心理是相似的，我处于中小城市，三月初就基本恢复正常工作和生活，加之国内媒体相关报道减少，直至今日，对疫情的感受，更像是想象的虚幻产物。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;空难事故的第四天，政治科科长建议头版头条登首相参拜见过神社，社会科科长说“空难事故不上头条了？……掉下来才四天哪！……” 到了第七天，编辑部已经回到了日航空难之前，那种普通的气氛之中。“明天就是一个星期了。怪不得古人发明了，七天一个星期的制度，原来人的心情，就是七天一个周期啊！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随着国内疫情的平息，意大利爆发了，美国爆发了，英国爆发了，全球红成一片，而我在平静生活。反思了下为何如此。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书中戳泪点的是123号空难遇难者遗书：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;爸爸觉得很遗憾&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是，跟你们一起，生活了那么长时间&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;迄今为止的人生，爸爸是非常幸福的，谢谢你们&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;智子，请好好照顾我们的孩子&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就像 我要远行一样&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想到国内疫情印象深刻的，并非媒体的长篇报道，而是微博上几条小视频，一个女生追着殡仪馆的车放声大哭，一个女性在阳台上敲锣喊“我有什么办法”，一个豆瓣友邻先后失去了父母。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开始每天花半小时上推特看国外报道。（结果被泰国网友笑死）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书的结尾是悠木和雅被贬到草津町的记者站，没有再离开过，在当地深深地扎下了根。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关注的摄影师A发了不少王者荣耀的动态，摄影师B去格鲁吉亚爬山了，过段时间去尼泊尔徒步了。而我好久没有进入创作的状态，家庭生活可以让人精神稳定，也消耗精力。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>树的同构 python - Isomorphic</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/isomorphic/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 21:26:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/isomorphic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;题目见ZJU数据结构 &lt;a href=&#34;https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/1211841066264109056/problems/1234055373040824320&#34;&gt;03-树1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;示例代码为C语言，网上文章也多是C语言。python有个是用数组实现的 &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/qq_39760343/article/details/83512918&#34;&gt;PTA 7-1 树的同构&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我最后用结点+数组实现（low是low了点&amp;hellip; 但示例里也是一个包含结点数据类型的数组，没差&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34; data-lang=&#34;c&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; TreeNode
{
  ElementType Elment;
  Tree Left;
  Tree Right;
} T1[MaxTree], T2[MaxTree];
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;以下为python代码：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;核心思想就是判断当前结点是否相同，如果不相同则为假，如果相同就递归判断t1左儿子t2左儿子是否相同，t1右儿子t2右儿子是否相同，否则就交换左右儿子，再进行递归判断&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#586e75&#34;&gt;# 建立结点的class&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;TreeNode&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b58900&#34;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;):

        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; data
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;left &lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; left

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#586e75&#34;&gt;# 在tree的数组中添加新结点&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#719e07&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#268bd2&#34;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;(Tree, index, item):

      <title>一二月刷砖小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202001_02_ablums/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 10:32:21 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202001_02_ablums/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;近四个月听了143张，今年听了79张，感觉需要总结下，不然记性不好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先讲下我是不会乐器+不懂乐理的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可能是年纪大了&amp;hellip; 不太能忍受脑子里过于混乱的世界，年初就找了找“如何欣赏爵士乐”？张煜锟
的&lt;a href=&#34;https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/60885882&#34;&gt;这篇&lt;/a&gt; 是我认为比较好，他把听音乐分为三个阶段：听旋律，听律动和节奏，听和声，听新的声音。之后是建立标准（就是对Jazz Standards有概念）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以他的框架，我可以听旋律、律动还有新的声音，比起旋律更偏好律动，由于不会乐理，和声没概念，标准曲没扫完。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面来说说我的框架：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;一涉猎主要分类&#34;&gt;一、涉猎主要分类&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我通常接触新事物，先把大的分类都涉猎一遍，知道什么是什么。类似于刚接触茶叶，先看分类标准，再把红茶绿茶乌龙茶黄茶白茶黑茶都喝一遍。食物和音乐的一个相似点是：如果没有用身体（嘴巴/耳朵）感受过，光用文字去描述是无法明白的（或许似乎明白，但如果对领域不熟悉，偏差会很大）。但吃到或者听到了，还是比较容易地分辨两种大类是不一样的。（如果你的舌头和耳朵木到一定程度&amp;hellip;那换个兴趣爱好吧）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;二关注时代背景&#34;&gt;二、关注时代背景&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;历史爱好者会不自觉地关注历史背景，美国爵士乐大的时间维度的线比较清晰，尤其是经典爵士乐，相关文章汗牛充栋，搜索书籍也出来一堆。但时间轴往近代推，或者把地点放到英国，中美洲，南美洲，非洲，就比较少。日本还蛮多的&amp;hellip; 有空可以再补补课。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;目前认为最大的影响因素是殖民加移民，日本音乐西化和明治维新、美军占领以及日本对西方文化的开放程度息息相关。英国的殖民地尼日利亚有Afro-Beat，英国本地音乐受非洲移民和印度移民影响。美国和古巴还有中美洲国家的关系，Bossa Nova的出现还有吸收雷鬼音乐的元素。黑人对爵士乐的发展就不说了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;三民族特色乐器&#34;&gt;三、民族特色乐器&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;个人偏好，我不太喜欢民族性太强的民族乐器出来的曲子，喜欢民族乐器fusion。关于这点我反思了一下，受制于我认为什么乐器是太民族的（和Jazz乐不搭的），而非洲鼓即使是传统面貌出现，也挺好的。
听民族乐器既像是寻找小产区茶叶（？）又像是寻找新声音。传统爵士乐乐器最喜欢萨克斯&amp;gt;小号&amp;gt;钢琴，除此之外，喜欢herbie mann的长笛，哥伦比亚的bongo鼓，日本的尺八( ̀⌄ ́)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;四总结&#34;&gt;四、总结&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我喝茶目前的状态是：中国大分类都喝过了，明确了喜欢乌龙茶&amp;gt;红茶&amp;gt;生普～白茶，不喜欢绿茶、熟普。乌龙茶里喜欢武夷岩茶和凤凰单丛，红茶喜欢正山小种和云南红茶。有几款茶叶多次回购，但也会尝试乌龙茶红茶里没喝过的品种或小产区。也会买国外没喝过的茶叶，印度的红茶（基本就是大吉岭了）马来的红茶，肯尼亚的红茶，南非的博士茶……茶叶还是比较简单的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;音乐三条线，一条是空间维度的横截面，以国家或地区看；一条是时间维度的纵结面，从变化看（这里既可以看大尺度的国家地区，也可以看小尺度的个体音乐人的变化）；第三条是交流传播的融合，当然三条不是孤立的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到茶友的一条微博，说在英国VA博物馆看到荷兰画家Nicolaes Verkolje在1715年的一幅作品，两位女士和一位男士在喝茶，注意到茶桌上摆放的差距是青花瓷，17和18实际我国出口到欧洲大量青花瓷器，除了茶杯，装废水的碗，还有放着放糖的小碟。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而我在听巨石典子的《石见银山》，发现石见银山真的是座山（？）是江户时代日本的银矿，而之前读《东南亚的贸易时代》时，注意到日本的白银开采以及银矿。蒸汽波里无数对动画和影视剧的文本挪用。发现好景俱乐部是文德斯拍的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不管是读书，还是音乐或者喝茶，都是增加了与世界的接口吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps: 茶叶是保守派&amp;hellip;什么桂花龙井，腊梅花茶，诸如此类都不想试。听歌最爱fusion 现在听歌像刚拍照时，按快门都有快感。不知道明年此时迷什么🤪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;五-待做&#34;&gt;五、 待做&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;基本乐理&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jazz Standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;虾米和网易云各选了张歌单：&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 21:38:39 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/horseman_bojack/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;这几年有三部剧是出了必追，马男波杰克，rick&amp;amp;morty还有摩斯探长前传。三部里马男又有些不一样，是唯一一部容易让人有代入感的剧。或者片面地说，每个喜欢马男的人，都从中或多或少地看见了自己。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;几天前看完马男第六季，回想15年看的第一季，已经想不清具体剧情，但现实的生活状态是很糟糕的，用简单的话说，丧到了极致。不少人说16年出的《伦敦生活》和Bojack Horesman比较像，去年尝试看了几集，不喜欢，看不进去。本身的状态会影响对一部作品的感情吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;整部剧里我带入感最多的是波杰克，不论是童年家庭创伤，还是更多是伤害别人，伤害了别人会道歉，但觉得自己意识到伤害别人并且道歉已经很好了，对方就应该原谅自己。如出一辙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后生活会教你做人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于Diana的书写不写出来，我更偏好于不写就不写了，不是说写了就放下，不写就没放下，没说出的话就不说了，没事的。但朋友说她不喜欢Diana最后settle down然后不再写之前想写的东西，感觉有一部分已经死了。是不抵抗了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看到Bojack和Diana坐在屋顶上聊天，他们真的是互相理解的人。但也能理解Diana最后选择和牛在一起，离开Bojack（即使是作为朋友）离开LA。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这几年，遇到动心的不算多，但也有。遇到理解的，真的没有。一部分是别人没有理解你的义务，另一部分是我也很难做到去让别人理解。朋友提供一个思路，可以把理解的部分转移到朋友而不是伴侣身上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从第四季开始，我就很烦Bojack不停地踩进同一个坑里，每次他要踩坑了，屏幕外的我内心就在大喊“你怎么就不能忍一忍？！！” 但这个结局真的太难过了，不管Bojack是去世还是没去世，朋友们都选择离开了他。最后一集更多是给大家交代。那天看完，我躺在床上，就想是不是有一天也会面临这种处境，然后想想现在的亲人和朋友，大家应该还是爱我的（？）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨晚出去喝酒，突然发现想不起来高中故友的真名了，只记得昵称，想了十秒想不起名字。头大。生命中离开的人和必经的遗忘，我接受了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近发朋友圈对我是进步吧，要继续练习诚实而不羞耻地说出想法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;真是一堆ego非常大的话。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;感谢马男陪伴过。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>瘟疫年纪事2</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 13:04:49 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;前几日一位本科学姐发了条朋友圈，说向ig举报一个账号被驳回，举报的原因是她认为这位艺术家价值观扭曲。我当时回复“她只是表达观点，从言论自由看没有问题啊。”账号是 @resistgirl.diary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;学姐认为该账号把肺炎叫做武汉肺炎，并且把患者画成是丧尸，是道德观扭曲。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先，我反对把患者丧尸，甚至偏好于称此次肺炎为2020nCoV而不是武汉肺炎。近几日读了一些传染病相关的书籍和资料，愈发感到，瘟疫是人类与致病菌的战役，感染者是受害者，而不是加害人，这与地域，与国家无关。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再者，我意识到如果这个账号不是香港人，而是什么其他国家特别如果是欧美人做的，我肯定已经出离愤怒，什么傻逼玩意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年和若曦聊到反林郑游行那段时间，她在剑桥的处境“似乎如果你是中华人民共和国公民，就带着原罪。” 搞不好说什么话，对方来一句“哦，你是中国大陆人啊。”自认为算是在港澳台同胞面前做的不错的大陆人。如果遇到港澳台同学（特别是港台同胞），我会说“我是大陆人（都不是是中国人了），我尊重台湾人民的选择，尊重香港人民的选择。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;具体到省份，我是浙江人，这次浙江是除湖北省外第二大重灾区，微博上有条我非常喜欢的发言：“浙江之所以患者多，是和武汉经济联系紧密；之所以这么多患者集中在浙江（许多武汉/湖北人回国选择的目的地是浙江），是因为浙江有资源有能力做这样的事，能有这样的机会为同胞服务，我觉得这是骄傲和荣光。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;或许是出于理解中国政府损害了香港和台湾民主自由的，我能理解和包容某些香港人和台湾人对大陆政府甚至是大陆人的仇视态度。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我尊重医护人员的罢工，尊重你们选择或者不选择封关，但我想说的是：每一次巨大的灾难下，历史总是惊人的相似，但是具体的人在受到痛苦、损害甚至生命的摧残。他们不是数字，也不是敌对政体的符号，他们只是普通人，是你我，希望大家停止对感染者的污名化和歧视。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;转一段早上刚看到的新民周刊李修文所写的文章&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“我特别觉得这次灾难中的年轻人非常可怜，比如说我认识的一个年轻人，他大年三十的晚上就已经发烧了，高度疑似。到我们这个年纪，在这座城市中，多多少少有点资源，可是年轻人不一样，他们刚到武汉没多久，20来岁，刚刚毕业，刚刚结婚，如果又是外地来武汉的人员，他们在武汉的人脉资源就更要比我们少得多，他们还没有享受这座城市给予他们的便利，就遇到了这样的灾难，很容易就乱了方寸。生了病没有办法确诊，没有办法住院，他们内心的焦虑、压力你都能感同身受，可以说是走投无路。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个大学老师，她的老公和父母都已经感染了，好像父亲已经去世了，她自己也高度疑似。在封城的情况下，她半岁的孩子谁来带？她发出的求救之声多么悲哀，已经不是救她的命，而是谁来救他们的孩子的问题了。
看见的听见的全是生离死别啊！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我很反感一种说法：“武汉按下了暂停键。”这是暂停键的问题吗？好像恢复了暂停键，一切就都恢复正常了似的。2008年汶川大地震的时候，我去过汶川，我的一个巨大的感受就是：创伤将永远停留在它遭到创伤的地方，一辈子都无法弥补！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本来确实打算写点东西，但实际上根本做不到。尤其我在网上看到一个视频：殡葬车在前面开，一个小女孩在后面跟着喊着妈妈妈妈。看到这个视频，我就受不了了，我的心特别乱。我所在的小区比较大，有一天我还听到一个中年男子在喊妈妈，那天又下着雨，真是“昔日戏言身后意，今朝都到眼前来”，它迫近得太厉害！那天以后我的心都是乱的，也没法写作，也读不进书了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我认识的朋友染病的越来越多，所以接到的求救也越来越多。我的同事、熟人，不管是疑似还是确诊的，我尽可能帮他们做做协调：怎么样能做上检测，怎么样才能住进医院。但是前几天还有些医院的朋友可以帮帮忙，这两天根本就不行了，连医院里的医生、护士自己得病了都住不上。这真是真实的绝望。我倒没有那么矫情地说什么“写诗是可耻的”，但确实，个人生活和个人内心的一道分水岭已经产生了，所以你很难再像过去一样生活。”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>瘟疫年纪事</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 19:07:24 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;说在前面，我还没读过《瘟疫年纪事》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;七号凌晨把豆瓣和饭否都注销了。
注销的导火线是李文亮医生死亡以及事件的后续发展，当晚明显过激，从十一点断断续续哭到四点不能入眠。半个月以来，虽说维持着日常生活和学习，但大崩溃就有三次：除夕夜，正月初九，正月十三。自然也不是单单李医生的死亡引发的情绪风暴，从武汉封城，除夕夜的春晚及微博对比，之后陆续爆出的物资分配，前方疫情报道，全国范围对武汉和湖北人的歧视，对外来人口的拒绝、封锁，微博上肺炎话题下的众多全家感染的求助信息，微信上湖北朋友告知的家人状况，募集捐赠物资朋友遇到的种种困难。The country is suffering. 悲伤、愤怒、无奈交织。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一边是肮脏龌龊不把人当人的诸多怪象，只想说，去他妈的吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是就自闭了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最早注意到疫情是二十号，也就是钟南山公开确认新型冠状病毒可以人传人，之前或许有看到消息，但不敏感，直接跳过了。至今二十多天，想讲讲几个点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一、卫生知识&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;疫情刚开始，暴露的基本矛盾是：修仙的九零后要求长辈带口罩和养生的中年人拒绝带口罩。也有朋友抱怨受相近水平的同龄人对肺炎风险的不理性思考使得他开始相信有些人注定是无法沟通，也无法被教育。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我认为，所有的知识或者观念都不是孤立的，要让一个人立马接受“疫情来了要带口罩”需要非常多的前置要求。个体的傻逼是无法避免的，但从九零后和九零前的对比可以看到基础教育普及后公共卫生常识的提高。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也在近期读了瘟疫相关的书籍，包括 《血疫》《瘟疫与人》《鼠疫斗士》。之前对传染病方面的知识相当欠缺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以及，对一个人的关心，不是“我让你带口罩你就带口罩”，“让你别出去就不要出去”。老一辈人某些行为既因为卫生常识欠缺，也因为在他们的观念里，春节和亲情的含义往往与我们不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二、It seems that the government don&amp;rsquo;t know &amp;ldquo;People are people, not numbers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不是第一天认识某国政府，但此次疫情中诸多行为，还是让我失去控制的愤怒，平时贪污腐败也就算了，现在是生命直接受到损害和摧毁。似乎有些人永远不明白也不会相信：人是目的而不是手段和数字。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;昨日在《中国国家治理的制度逻辑》的读书笔记中写&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“首先，想说说为什么最近想读关于“统治与被统治“的话题，可以说，我是个对中国语境里的政治没有兴趣的人，特别是“权力“。对国家理解的兴趣，更多体现在文化建构、身份认同等等的维度上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中二时期，由于对权力的反感，甚至认为无政府主义才是理想的政治制度。当然，如今的观点是，某些活动需要大于个体的组织中才能实现。结合当下，此次疫情中种种怪象也激发了对中国行政管理的问题的好奇和困惑。武汉政府乃至中央政府一开始对疫情的隐瞒（当时就想到经济学中的代理人问题）；卫健委以及红十字会对物资的分配统筹；社区对居民的管理，和医疗机构的对接…………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;周雪光这本书的副标题为“一个组织学研究“。如果对权力不感兴趣，是否可以从组织员、公共管理的技术方面理解这些现象？（大组织也常见管理问题）”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果在行为上无法正面对抗，只能先去更了解房间中的大象。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三、同侪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近来最欣慰的是，和朋友们在基本原则上没有冲突，甚至有几位朋友做了令我相当敬佩的事，也是朋友们不断提供着信息、情感支持和安慰。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;注销这两个常用的社交平台，没有不适应，但有些不习惯。从初中时代上网以来，迄今为止和外界切断最彻底的几日。中学时代，我的网络人格外向到了极致，是完全敞开的状态。后来发生了转变，越来越封闭，只想让认识的朋友关注。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;梳理一遍朋友名单，发现有很大比例没有任何活跃的社交平台。我本以为上社交网站是为了关心朋友，其实满足的更多的是个人表达需求。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三天里，读了几本书，玩了两天经营类模拟手游，写了几千字的读书笔记，时隔多年安装了RSS订阅器，重新写博客。希望新的一年里，能更沉稳，把时间和精力更放在关心的人身上。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>二零一九小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2019_summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 19:35:15 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2019_summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018年没有写小记，现在对全年的状态已经有些恍惚。所以今年还是要写。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19年的第一天说，&amp;ldquo;14年在和食欲、自我怀疑斗争 15-16年在和酒瘾、抑郁、自我否定斗争 17年在和焦虑、无意义感斗争 18年可以说是第一次获得inner peace的一年。&amp;rdquo; 这个年末最想说，自己是个幸福的人（？今年真的很开心，觉得一切都很好。特别是朋友们，每次见朋友心里可能都在唱歌（？）最大的感概是：二十岁以前都在和精神创伤struggle，时不时会伤害到身边的人，今年发现自己常常能给朋友们带来快乐和安慰，挺开心的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;负面影响是过于平和，甚至有点快乐的虚假。时常感到自己把负面的情绪或者是想法刻意地忽略。对细微之处的感受力也下降了。有时候都要对自己说：不要太开心，要思考！&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;香港的事对我影响很大，第一次想离开，中间有些应急创伤的表现，之一是年中对中国的东西有抵触的情绪，看书基本不看国内作者，小说读原文，也不想读国内历史。模模糊糊中在自我认知中突出了自己是南方人，感觉是在不喜欢主流中国叙事和喜欢中国的某些部分的折衷选择，毕竟我们江南人儒学都是黄宗羲顾炎武，还有东南互保。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上半年和下半年挺不一样的，上半年又拧巴了，浑浑噩噩的，一边喝了很多酒（可能超过三次喝多了），一边“疯狂跑步”，获得了5km25min以内的成就（这是今年最后一次说了，再也不说了&amp;hellip;）马来回来突然心变宽阔了，做了个决定，努力学习，九月很努力地学了雅思，考了7.5（我还挺擅长考试的&amp;hellip;）十月弄材料，十一月十二月是算法。一边工作一边学习，时间梭梭过去。下半年着实很忙碌，又要赚钱又要照顾弟弟又要学习还要锻炼/读书/喝酒etc&amp;hellip; 忙碌后很难有经历讨论抽象问题和大问题。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还是没有对象的一年，连和人建立友情关系都是每年一两个的。但也意识到，多元的关系支撑着我的生活。也想明白，在relationship上有点想settle down，但在生活上还不想settle down。我也不是能换个生活状态就换个对象的人，当然身边也有朋友辗转多年辗转世界各地最后生活上也都settle down的，这……我不奢求。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有天说“作为业余读者，我应该既不左派又不女权，自己给自己贴标签是历史社会和类型小说爱好者，平等自由观念的绝对主义者，在文化多样性上是个相对主义者，着迷于历史的细节和复杂性，可以聊抽象建构，可以解构但没推到极端的虚无。即使世界是幻象，这个幻想也足够真实。几乎讨厌所有的“本质”问题，可以快速地对事物下判断，即使是错了也没事，知道错了再调整就可以了。” 这差不多总结了现在的三观，还发现如果硬要套标签，以前我是个政治左，经济右，现在经济光谱逐渐左移。例如，以前我非常支持自由市场，不喜欢任何形式的税收和福利制度。但现在我的观点是：不是经济而是政治经济，经济力量会自然地寻找政治力量的合谋。在这种情况下，只有用理想的好的政治力量去建立保护弱者的制度。（假设制度合理）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《一七年小记》里说“去年一月的感受是“最好把所有的输入渠道都‘调教’成可流动的状态，大概的意思是社交上想要认识新朋友，渠道abc有一些备选，也会有些新的人加入；信息上控制信息源，关注的话题肯定有，另外也会时不时出现一些没接触的概念、问题。以此逐渐延伸自己的触角。”过了一年，这个想法依然持续。” 今年还想到沟通和理解的问题，思路有点像17年和朋友谈过的&lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/post/whatsaboutmeaning/&#34;&gt;定义&lt;/a&gt;“所有对客观存在的评价都是一对客观存在（reality）和观点（viewpoint）的couple，客观存在只有一个，但观点会有我的观点（Vi），个体A的观点（Va），某些个体组成的某个群体的观点（Vgroup），主流的观点（Vmainstream）甚至理论上存在一个全集的观点（Vall）” 我想的是，如果两个人聊起同一个事物，脑内是不同的圆，并集有大有小。比方说性别，生理性别+心理性别都为女性，大家都认同是女性，很容易在并集里。但边缘的case，生理性别女+心理性别男在不同人的定义里更可能不一样。其他事物也是一样的。存在一段时间的领域，都有一些不能躲避的问题或者概念或者其他什么，不管是什么路径，总会遇到的。大多数领域都有经典化的整理过程，新领域就是一片混沌的战场了。既要看到作为结果的经典，也要看到结果之前的可能性。所以学习更多，把触角延伸到更多的领域，还可以增进和别人的交流（? 这也是我为什么越来越少不跟陌生人沟通，任何人的观念是受限于ta的成长经历甚至是其他学科知识，成年人是没法从单一点驳倒的，前置太多了，三观不是个纯思辨问题，是实践相关的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;不能适应国内大都市生活了。
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这不是说我不爱城市了。我对城市的兴趣引导我读了很多书。&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/doulist/45028941/&#34;&gt;城市研究 地方史 当代移民&lt;/a&gt;。至今也能享受大城市的快乐，每次去上海探亲找朋友玩都很开心。但知道我没有承受其中的代价，会让我有罪恶感。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我的三观就是反消费主义的。虽然偶尔在社交上为了做个平和的人，不怎么批判。在我的三观里，所有过度的买买买，占有超出自己需要的物品就是不好的。如果兴趣爱好是昆虫，收集了超多的标本，这是另一回事。这里我自己也没想清楚，或者说，我理想的是尽量把物品作为物品，而不是更看重它背后的符号和一些其他的东西。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有些特别开心的事：
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;二月在东湖公园发现特别美的梅花树（初恋梅花树）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;跑了两次杭州两次上海，交到了两个新朋友！&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;旅行去了十多天广西，十多天马来西亚，短暂去了天台、泉州、广州、福州。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;夏天的芒果和西瓜很好吃。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;春天和夏天经常逛园子。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;寄的杨梅朋友们都很喜欢。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;隔了多年又从音乐中获得快乐。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还干了些乱七八糟的事：（发现自己真是个爱学习的人&amp;hellip;但通常玩到80分就懒得挖下去了&amp;hellip;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;冬天练了一段时间瑜伽（上墙倒立！）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;精酿啤酒的兴趣爱好有80分，基本上所有的品类，市面上能见到的大厂小厂都喝过吧。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;咖啡就简单喝了下，会做手冲了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;是个出门会带跑鞋和茶具的没有条件也要创造条件的年轻人了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;做饭比去年好吃了一丢丢。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;更新了12篇博客，3篇是读书总结，写了两篇认真的书评。（虽然不行，但好像还能写？）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看到年初的某个flag。
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读12本英文书（10/12）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读5本德语书（0/5）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;锻炼150次（151/150）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;吉他200小时（8/200） 但我有认真听歌😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;最多买3个杯子（应该差不多，基本没买）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;旅行20天（41/20）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;见10次人类（89/10）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;不买超过2斤茶叶，3磅咖啡，5瓶酒（这就不算了，起码比以前买的少&amp;hellip;）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020年的flag：
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;顺利出行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;学德语，在21年学三外前好好巩固二外😂 目标是德福4水平，现在估计是B2水平&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读12本英文书&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读5本德文书&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;锻炼150次&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;听jazz, funk, soul 努力学习乐理&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;做好计划，拍一组完成度较高的摄影项目&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;应该是学不动乐器的&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>爵士乐自听记录</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/portrait_in_jazz/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:48:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/portrait_in_jazz/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;倒是没想到今年能在音乐上说些什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19年4月倒是整理过&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/note/716092162/&#34;&gt;《音乐兴趣转向》&lt;/a&gt; 里面提到16开始听歌量暴跌，从原来的每年平均150张到16-18每年平均50张。也曾想过可能的原因，猜测可能是情绪上的开关关上了，很难或者说不想沉溺于从前音乐会带来的陷入感，毕竟年轻时是听don’t look back in anger会哭的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拿书籍、图像、音乐三者比较，大多数书籍是自带reference的，即使不像学术专著一样有专门的列表，也会在文本中出现与其他文本有关的链接。一个有略微探索精神的人是比较容易的就可以在不同的书籍、作家里跳来跳去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图像中自带的reference也比较少，但可以快速浏览，有大概的印象，摄影的历史较短，主要流派的脉络都比较清晰，经典作品并没有那么多。我大多数的自我教育都依靠书店里的摄影和画集专区。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;音乐，如果考虑到现代电子乐的各种采样，reference可能是三者间最多的。但书籍的reference是你不知道它告诉你，音乐的reference你要先了解它refer的对象，还要在后继的歌曲中辨别出可能结果改变的版本。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果让我现在总结，为什么听砖量暴跌，我会觉得是在那个阶段，我不知道该听什么了。找书靠书之间的reference，豆瓣还有多年来积累的书友，就算我不订阅任何书讯，每年增加的想读都远远超过能消耗的数量。摄影，知道自己在某个停滞的地方，每年花点时间关注追踪的摄影师或者摄影奖项就可以了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;音乐，中学时用songtaste，后来用虾米、豆瓣、网易云。16年那个阶段是，我不管用虾米和网易的算法推荐，还是豆瓣音乐”你可能喜欢的唱片“，找到的专辑往往都不对味，连着听了几张三星的专辑就不想找下去了。这个问题部分归罪于我的别扭，既不喜欢看摄影批评，也不喜欢看乐评，而上面说的音乐的特征必定是需要非音乐的媒介起链接的作用。
另一方面是没有人可以交流。近几年书友倒是越来越多，自感在书友中也挣到了一些credit。高中时代还有一两个同学可以分享最近听到喜欢的专辑，大一时遇到个学姐说喜欢Suede就可以当朋友了，但自音乐品味越来越杂越来越偏后，就没有听友了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我也忘了今年为什么突然想认真听爵士了。以前应该也有尝试过认真听古典和爵士，但失败了。可能是意识到了问题所在，我选中了村上的《爵士乐群英谱》（因为这是微信读书上唯一有资源的爵士乐相关书籍&amp;hellip;）我的读法是，不看内容，只看名字和唱片名&amp;hellip;每天选定一个乐手的专辑（可以是村上推荐的，也可以豆瓣上评价人数较多较高的），如果喜欢，再听该乐手更多的专辑，增加印象。在听歌过程中，查询下专辑乐器的配置、乐手名字、年代、风格。目前大致了解了几大传统爵士风格：Big Band, Swing, Bebop, Hardbop, Cool Jazz。偶尔和某友邻交流（感谢友邻！），跳到后面听了些Jazz Hiphop, Smooth, Funk 也很喜欢。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明年的计划就是往后往Postbop, Avant-garde, Free, Fusion, smooth, funk听。我应该会蛮喜欢Fusion和Funk。如果有能力的话，能学习些乐理知识是最好的了quq&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;必须承认，村上的品味还是不错的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;列一下书中喜欢的乐手：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chet Baker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlie Parker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art Blakey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Mingus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Evans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miles Davis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gerry Mulligan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Advent of Code 2018&amp;2019 上星之旅</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/aoc_1819/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 09:41:55 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/aoc_1819/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;aoc全称&lt;a href=&#34;https://adventofcode.com/2019&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;advent of code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;，是每年12月1日开始圣诞节结束的趣味编程比赛，每天两道题，第一道做出来才有机会做第二道，但前面日期的题没做出来也可以做后面日期的题。以数据结构和算法为主，11月cpy推荐我玩（被虐）一下，2018年做到d9，上了16颗星，2019年做到d16，也上了16颗星，d18涉及的吃豆人类似的路径查找实在不会做，就止步了。希望明年可以上更多的星。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aoc是最近刷题中趣味性最强，最好玩的题目，所以想整理一下上星心得。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aoc-2018&#34;&gt;aoc 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day1-day2&#34;&gt;day1-day2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;简单到不用说&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day3&#34;&gt;day3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考二维数组的计算，我用了np.array&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day4&#34;&gt;day4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题对当时的我还蛮难的，是给一串string数据，告诉你guard在哪个时刻睡觉，哪个时刻醒，要你根据数据判断哪个guard睡的最多，并且在哪个分钟睡的最多。
part2是先判断哪个分钟睡的最多，用的都是dateframe groupby后的sort_values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;写出了个bug是有行代码是验证切割分钟时间的左边界和右边界是否存在 结果边界=0，就是时间是0:00的时候&amp;hellip; 它当做不存在。。。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个题目我用了很朴素的做法，cpy科普了离散化处理，但我太懒重新搞一遍，就过了&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day5&#34;&gt;day5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题叫消消乐&amp;hellip;第一个递归，bug遇到的是递归的return的结果是什么&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day6&#34;&gt;day6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还是二维数组，但还设计曼哈顿距离，这道题是判断边界的延伸（说起来比较抽象了）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;判断是否延伸我先用了再生成几行Z，看两者的数据有没有差异，有差异的就是infinite，但这样不能解决左上的，一开始没想出来，后来是找出z里最左边和最上边行列unique的值，把这些值的都去掉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一开始还想算出可以最小生成的矩阵，减少运算，但这样坐标要做相对处理&amp;hellip; 非常复杂，搞不出来，最后用了绝对的，但计算width和height还是有用&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day7&#34;&gt;day7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新的数据类型，图。之前没学过图&amp;hellip; 看了一天的资料才知道怎么下手。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;两个bug：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;给的测试数据，一开始入度为0的只有一个，给的数据有4个，除了选择start还要在queue中添加剩余的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;第一遍做出来答案已经是对的了，但忘了英语有26个字母，给的数据，邻接表左边有25个字母，右边有26个，最后的情况是 graph已经被消除等于零了，queue中还有最后一个值是“X”，按我的做法没有添加进去，结束条件是len(graph) == 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day8&#34;&gt;day8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题不是自己做出来的&amp;hellip; 知道要用递归，但就是写不出正确的。
最后看了别人动态规划的思路&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day9&#34;&gt;day9&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题还是挺朴素的模拟，第二题应该和算法复杂度有关，但我不会做，愣跑了三个半小时跑出了答案。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aoc-2019&#34;&gt;aoc 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day1&#34;&gt;day1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;简单&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day2&#34;&gt;day2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part2题目差点看不懂。。。cpy说是图灵机，涉及如何避免可变对象的变化（list传递还要保持原先的list），最后用了暴力string生成新的list&amp;hellip; 来reset
今年的aoc每隔两天都是An Intcode program的题目，又麻烦又只是模拟，只是更复杂的模拟，太不喜欢做了，把所有相关的题目都跳过了。。。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day3-1&#34;&gt;day3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题考两个线段的相交点，用了离散化的处理做出来了呢。。。结果part2的题目，如果part1不是用离散化的处理会更好做，所有part2就没做。。。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day4-1&#34;&gt;day4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不管它想考我什么，反正我用了正则表达式&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day6-1&#34;&gt;day6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图算法，用了递归，还涉及了全局函数要写句global&amp;hellip;
part2还有最小公共祖先。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day8-1&#34;&gt;day8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这道题挺简单的，但最后有个根据1/0的值生成出像素，看出密码。我是手动用excel画出来的。。。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day10&#34;&gt;day10&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;题目是要算一个直线的斜率，用二元一次函数直接除出斜率会导致浮点数误差。搞得我去研究了下Decimal，结果最后是用了反三角函数atan才做对。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day12&#34;&gt;day12&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part2和去年的day9的part2很像，但如果朴素，计算次数是10^10次方&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;一定要用O(1)的hashmap查找&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;优化思路不是数据结构类型的，而是算法类型的，这道题的x,y,z三个坐标是独立的，分别算循环周期，然后算三个周期的最小公倍数。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day14&#34;&gt;day14&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;图，考入度为0且有偏度的图遍历。
part2又考算法，又考时间复杂度，没做出来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day16&#34;&gt;day16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;很简单的模拟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;总结&#34;&gt;总结&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;个人认为aoc的题目比单纯刷题好，因为题目和最终答案经常绕了超过三个弯，我从一开始的看完题目就挣扎着写，到写代码前先想好几个主要步骤，每个步骤的函数输入输出分别是什么，什么格式的。aoc2018的题目基本每天我都要做个四五个小时，才能做出来，还动不动写出bug。aoc2019思路对的话，一小时多一点就能搞定了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;题目难度从一维列表，二维列表，到图，到递归，再往后不知道是什么了。一二维列表目前没问题，图和树只能做最简单的遍历或者最短路径。递归十个有九个想不清楚return回来的是什么&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;待深入：
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;做题经常不考虑复杂度分析（我连最朴素的都做不出来考虑啥复杂度分析）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;树、图、动态规划、递归&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这两个月还是有进步一丢丢&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;有图版见豆瓣 &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.douban.com/review/12078051/&#34;&gt;https://book.douban.com/review/12078051/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文 / Jarry 编辑 / Weixi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为半个摄影爱好者，我对学术界的摄影批评和摄影理论抱有偏见，以苏珊·桑塔格的《论摄影》为例，我没见过有哪位摄影师说：“《论摄影》对我造成了巨大的影响。”但除去这些，谈论摄影的书又相当少。个中缘由，一半归于摄影师通常都懒得解释自己的作品，张克纯在一次访谈中就说过“对我而言，我更喜欢用我擅长的方式表达，摄影它是我说话的方式，我觉得说清楚了，就没必要让它更复杂，好比我已经说过一遍话了，就不想再赘述一遍”；一半归于摄影师通常都不善写作，植田正治受《每日摄影》邀请，写名为《小传记》的连载文章时，便多次提到自己“不擅长写文章，是抱着出丑的心态写的，可想而知文笔有多差”。（不是谦虚，真的很差）所以，今年这本英国玛格南摄影师大卫·赫恩和比尔·杰伊的访谈录《摄影师手册》是意外的惊喜。作为同样文笔不好的摄影师，大卫·赫恩自小患有阅读障碍，因此他选择用访谈的方式讨论了若干重要的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这本书适合不熟悉摄影的读者，书中并没有太多关于摄影技术的内容（器材、感光度等），而是阐述方法论，方法论是相通的，无论是关乎创作，还是用于做社会研究；也适合拍了一些照片，消耗了一些按快门的热情，对下一步如何进阶感兴趣的摄影爱好者，他们可以从书中得到可实践的建议：如何处理单张照片的内容和色彩，如何开展有主题的摄影项目？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一、谁是大卫·赫恩？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大卫·赫恩于1967年正式成为玛格南图片社成员，但他在中国的摄影圈却籍籍无名，至今没有出版过任何一本中文版摄影集。他的第一个重要摄影项目，是拍摄了1956年反抗苏联统治的匈牙利革命。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1955年12月，大卫·赫恩在桑赫斯特皇家军事学院服义务兵役，有一天，他偶然在杂志《图片邮报》上看到一张照片：一位苏联军官和妻子在莫斯科的百货商店里买帽子。他想起“二战”期间，父亲参军，每次回家，都会带全家去购物。他们会去卡迪夫的豪沃斯百货商店给妈妈买帽子。这是他第一次看到父亲与母亲之间的爱情——一起做某件事，分享彼此的快乐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时是冷战期间，苏联人在英国政治宣传中被塑造为会吃自己的孩子之类的可怕形象。那张照片让大卫意识到：“他们就像是我的爸爸和妈妈，他们都是普通人。”比起政治宣传，他更相信这张照片上的真实。那一刻起，他决定成为一位摄影师——走出去，用照片去诚实地记录所看到的一切，把自己的观察展示给别人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;很久之后，他才知道那张照片是布列松拍的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二、“决定性瞬间”？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比起“决定性瞬间”，大卫·赫恩更相信孕育瞬间（pregnant moment）。他认为，一张好照片由两个要素决定，站在哪里拍以及何时拍。好的摄影师应当判断哪个画面可能孕育出好照片并耐心等待。在这里，他以自己拍摄的《漫步滕比》为例，谈到：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是一张看似复杂、实际上很简单的照片。
我抵达那里之后，马上便看到一些元素：大炮、睡着的人、狗。我迅速调整到一个位置，以便让三个基本元素彼此独立却又能在整体上形成一道显著的对角线。这就是所要考虑的拍摄机位。我拍了一张，但明白这不是自己想要的，就我的风格来说，有点过于静态了。所以我走开，来到山的另一边，看出了几张有可能拍到的照片，便重返原先的地点。现在，热闹起来了。基本元素还在，但人们正在爬上大炮后面的山，一些人沿着地平线向左边走去，有人坐着，还有一个男孩骑在大炮上玩。我找到先前的位置，略做调整，以便能将坐着的人拍进去，这时候我就看着其余处于动态的人，看他们的互动所形成的各种视觉构图。我连拍了一组照片，因为不确定这些运动变量是否能在最恰当的一刻刚好被捕捉。唯有在接触印样上，我才能找出所有元素和谐交融的那一张。在这个例子中，关键的前景元素静止不动，因此我可以奢侈地只凝神于那些副元素。
比尔·杰伊也讲了件轶事。在一场摄影展览中，有人拉住爱德华·斯泰肯，问道：“如果把所有那些‘偶然’的作品都拿掉，你还能留下几张呢？” “可能就没多少了，”爱德华·斯泰肯回答，“但你有没想过，伟大的摄影师拍到过多少张伟大的偶然？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三、主观的真实和风格&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;赫恩认为，照片中不存在客观，因为在摄影中只有两个基本把控：站在哪里，何时按下快门。两者都是主观的选择，所以最终的结果，即照片，自然也是主观的。摄影师唯一能做的是尽量忠实于拍摄主题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这让我想到人类学和社会学的研究，这类研究往往在一开头就提醒我们研究者的局限性，因为每个人看到的世界都受限于自身观看的方式，而这也是“独特风格”的来源。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每位摄影师都有独特的个性，如果你选择那些对你有私人意义的主题，那么没有人可以模仿你。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;赫恩认为摄影——以及所有创作的魔力，都在于此。每个人或多或少都有相似性，但如果你看十二张布列松、寇德卡或者罗伯特·弗兰克的照片，你也能轻易地分辨出他们是不同的人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以你应当专注于你的拍摄对象，思考如何通过照片呈现出自己不同的观点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;约翰·加德纳曾说：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就讲述新鲜故事而言，文学已经枯竭了好几个世纪；但就讲述原型故事，再次尝试阐释其真理并向后代传递其智慧而言，只有当我们所有人因自己愚蠢的傲慢而将它抛弃时，文学才会真正枯萎。
对摄影来说，也同样如此。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;四、如何开展摄影项目？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;赫恩对摄影项目的建议，让我想到写毕业论文时指导老师建议我们如何决定选题，除了成果不是文字，而是照片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.列出自己真正感兴趣的东西&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影师必须对主题有强烈的好奇心，不能仅仅是一时的视觉兴趣。摄影师首先要做的决定是“拍什么”，你对主题的好奇、沉迷和狂热，都能通过所拍摄的图片传递给他人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.主题尽可能具体&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比尔·杰伊给的例子是：“如果学生提出的是‘维多利亚时代的人像摄影’，我会建议改为‘刘易斯·卡罗尔的爱丽丝小像研究’。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.思考这些主题的可实践性&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去除无法用图像表达的（比如说社交网络上的人际关系），正常情况下无法拍摄的（我是生活在中国的普通人，那我想拍某个非洲国家的内战，就是痴人做梦），再去除你对其一无所知的（你需要对拍摄对象有深入的研究），最后去除目标受众过小的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.长时间追踪选择的主题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这便于在你愿意并且有时间的时候，随时可以重返这个主题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;故乡威尔士是大卫·赫恩最长久、最丰富的拍摄项目，从二十世纪六十年代开始，他便持续拍摄煤矿产业日渐衰退的威尔士；而如今，他拍摄发展高科技、文化、旅游产业的威尔士。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五、如何对待外国文化？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017年，赫恩出版了新的摄影集《亚利桑那之旅》，该项目拍摄了他在1979至2001年间拜访的美国亚利桑那州。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在《摄影师手册》的最后，大卫·赫恩和比尔·杰伊聊了几个经典的摄影误区，其中之一是：摄影师不该拍摄异域风情。这个观点的理由是：你无法真正理解另一种文化、另一个种族或群体，除非你生长在此地，因此，你拍下的照片无非是猎奇，并不真实。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;赫恩认为，不管拍摄的是本国人还是外国人，都是在主观地表达自己的观点。如果按照这一误区的逻辑推演，最后的结论是摄影师什么人都不能拍。而事实上，人类彼此的相似性远甚于差异性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我想，这也是为什么摄影发展的历史中，街拍或是拍摄普通人的普通生活拥有持久的魅力，不管是布列松拍摄的苏联，弗兰克拍摄的美国，我们都能在其中看到我们熟悉的事物、情感，那些父亲母亲孩子，猫猫狗狗，人类共享的悲伤和快乐。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;六、摄影师和被拍摄者的关系&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;街拍不可避免地会涉及被拍摄者，我非常喜欢大卫对被拍摄者的态度。他告诉我们，从摄影项目之初，就要选择自己真心热爱的主题，而不是浮光掠影的捕捉，这既是为了能深入主题，也是对拍摄者的尊重。他说：“你不可能在后街转悠一圈，抓拍几张门廊里的无家可归者，就在城市贫困问题上指导江山。那是剥削利用，不是进行研究。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大卫在一次访谈中提到一张照片，拍的是1967年苏格兰某汽车俱乐部的舞会，照片中，一位退休男人在玩一只气球。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这张照片告诉了我摄影的本质问题：你在拍摄另一个人的图像。我一直注意不去打扰被拍摄者。当我拍照时，我不会拍那些以任何方式轻视别人的照片。我试着把人抽象成符号，在这张照片里，一个老年人享受着衰老后的快乐——但我也记得他们是具体的人。在这张照片发表后的很多年之后，我收到了一封来自这个男人妻子的信，告知我他去世了。但她也告诉我，他们在全世界看到过无数次这张照片，每次，它都给他们带来了快乐。她问我是否可以给她一张打印版。知道我照片里的人非常享受被拍摄对我来说是一种安慰，虽然我从不试着去了解他们是谁。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;八、大卫·赫恩的摄影人生&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017年，BBC拍了部大卫·赫恩的纪录片。八十三岁的赫恩老爷爷现在住在英国威尔士瓦伊河沿岸的丁登镇，片中，他无论去哪，都依然背着个小相机。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;纪录片中，他不无无奈地说：“以我现在的年龄，我需要做的是找到可以容易继续拍照的事物。乡村生活的美丽在于，首先，你可以参与；其次，当一个人变老了，就很难拿着照相机到处走，在乡村，我还能从一头走到另一头。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我看到老爷爷拍了张照片就放下相机，拿起了小饼干，可可爱爱！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后的彩蛋：老爷爷年轻时这么帅！&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;前半部分是每个章节个人认为有趣部分的简单概括，作者行文的思路是，按照时间叙事，把致力于服装业的人和当时日本乃至世界（主要是美国）的社会背景结合起来。后半部分是个人感想。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有图版见豆瓣 &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.douban.com/review/12078051/&#34;&gt;https://book.douban.com/review/12078051/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One: A Nation without Style&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kensuke Ishizu 石津谦介（已破产）出生于明治时代的最后一年—1911年，是一位纸张批发商的二儿子。日本明治维新的西化运动使日本人开始接受西式服装。由于害怕左翼思潮，政府在1930s停止推动自由化。二战期间，Ishizu开始在中国天津的亲戚开的百货公司做营销工作，当时天津作为通商口岸，有很多欧洲人，Ishizu更加融入了西式生活。二战结束后，Ishizu回到日本，创办了Van Jacket。当时，日本男性是不能对时装感兴趣的。Ishizu的一大问题是解决关键问题。日本第一期男性服装杂志是《妇人画报》的增刊，《Otoko no Fukushoku》。在初创时期，Ishizu给杂志写了很多稿子，多到他需要起不同的笔名来增加文章的权威性。第五期后，改名为《Men&amp;rsquo;s Club》。1959年，Van开始发行“Ivy Model&amp;rsquo;系列，美国常春藤大学学生的穿衣风格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two: The Ivy Cult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1950s，日本学生的服装非常单调（包括大学生），只有黑色羊毛的Gakuran。当时的社会环境是，学生只能穿校服，工作才能穿西装，要穿到大学毕业，面试都要穿校服。除此之外的服装都被视为不遵守规则的delinquents（罪犯）。包括被Van的Ivy风格吸引的年轻人，而在美国，Ivy风格是保守精英的代表。当时日本没有厂商可以生产Ivy风格的衣服，一部分是因为不明白具体工艺，一部分是没有实物，信息往往来自于美国时装杂志，比如说GQ刊登的关于Brooks Brothers的文章。为了宣传和普及他们臆想出的Ivy风格，Van的雇员（兼职Men&amp;rsquo;s Club的作者）写了很多Ivy风格的dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts，还发明了街拍，拍下银座出没看着像是类似风格的行人，刊登在杂志上。“Ivy Leagues on the Streets”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1960s随着战后第一波婴儿潮进入大学和经济的复苏，Van取得了巨大的成功。Ivy穿着的年轻人出没在银座引起了社会的不安，甚至警察出动进行了一次清扫活动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three: take Ivy to people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于成功设计了1964年东京奥运会开幕式日本队的服装（白色衬衫白色裤子红色西装外套）和在银座举行了一次成功的演讲，劝说年轻人不要在银座瞎逛，Ishizu改善了Ivy风格在主流社会眼中的形象。在日本放开民间出国游后，Van组织了一个团队去美国拍摄真正的常春藤风格，去了之后发现大多是学生都穿得非常随便，极少符合他们的臆想。但仍旧经过遴选，出版了电影和摄影集《take ivy》，多年后，此书成为常春藤风格男装圣经。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外，同期Van引进了帆布鞋，取得了巨大的成功。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four: The Jeans Revolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本章讲述了牛仔裤如何在日本开始流行，以及日本人偏好柔软的、有使用痕迹的牛仔裤&amp;hellip; 一开始商品来源是从美国进口二手牛仔裤。日本本地的厂商生产出新的牛仔裤卖不出去，只能买好多台洗衣机在厂里拼命洗拼命洗&amp;hellip; 最大的一家是Big John。社会运动是是马克思主义学生运动和长发嬉皮士。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five: Cataloging America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于马克思主义学生运动和越战，1968年的NHK调查，只有31%的日本人选择“我喜欢美国”，相比于1964的49%大幅跌落。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole Earth Catalog 是1970s美国激进分子Stewart Brand主编的指导自己来（do it yourself)指南。人要使用工具，学习技能，自己的事情自己做（？）。这股运动推动了户外运动在日本的发展，日本人开始滑雪，野营，变逐渐发展出了重工系服装（？？？？真是意想不到的操作呢&amp;hellip;）以及Popeye为代表的city boy风格，因为东京空地少，popeye主推了滑板作为流行城市男孩喜欢的运动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popeye还首创了在杂志页面铺满商品图片，每个标注好品牌和价格、商店名称和经销商价格，混合了杂志编辑和广告。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six: Damn Yankees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我对原宿和里原宿风格完全不感冒&amp;hellip; 简单来说是受摇滚乐影响，黑帮和飞车党当时流行的是regent头，souvenir jacket（美军撤军，飞行员让裁缝在飞行夹克上刺日本风格的鸟啊龙啊。），皮夹克。除了银座（ginza）、涩谷、原宿、表参道（omotesando）和竹下通（takeshita）也开了很多服装店，时尚街头&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven: Nouveau Riche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1976年，Beams设立了，出来一批美国品牌自选店(authentic foreign goods)。1976-1979，日美汇率从300:1涨到200:1，1977年，政府放开外汇管制，允许旅行者携带3000美元现金出境。日本中年阿姨去法国和意大利买了超多奢侈品。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivy以Preppy（学院风）风格复新了，van破产，日本年轻人直接购买Brooks Brothers等美国品牌。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1980s，日本设计师川久保玲(Rei Kawakubo)和山本耀司(Yohji Ymamoto)在巴黎成名，将日本时尚带到了全球舞台，之后还有三宅一生(Issey Miyake)和高田贤三（Kenzo Takada)，日本时装界迎来了带有日本气息的欧洲前卫风格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时比较有影响力的杂志还有hot dog press。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;beams plus 2019-2020 autumn/winter - all you need is ivy
Eight: From Harajuku to Everywhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在摇滚、朋克、新浪潮(new wave)后，hip-hop和DJ成了新的音乐流行趋势。藤原浩(Hiroshi Fujiwara)和長尾智明(Tomoaki Nagao)是当时日本嘻哈界的领军人物。前者创办了A bathing Ape，这应该就是国内所说的街头潮牌（？）。川久保玲类似的设计师服装可以用高价来维持威望，但里原宿风格的基本产品（卫衣、T恤）相对来说不能那么高价，但又需要维持品牌形象，藤原浩他们的解决方案是“make less”。这激起了消费者的狂热，限量版使得年轻人购买衣物为了收集他们而不是简单的穿他们。作者认为，这样的策略影响了美国的很多服装公司的宣传策略，比如说限量版（nike的AJ），比如说联名款。A bathing ape在国际上取得了很大的成功，在美国、亚洲纷纷开店。（但最终被I.T.收购。）长尾智明参与设计优衣库U.T.和adidas originals。另一个牌子UNDERWEAR的高桥盾（Jun Takahashi）设计了nike的时尚运动产品线Gyakusou。（我竟然还知道这个产品线？？）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine: Vintage and Replica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开始是发现最新的Levis 501没以前的501好穿（这也能发现？），从牛仔裤开始，最后掀起的古着潮流。不停从美国的偏远地区的商店购入大量存货运回日本（Vintage silk road）。研究出不同时期Levis 501的标签，发展出了很多古着黑话。美国人都要问日本人怎么穿牛仔裤。（终于知道小时候听来的牛仔裤不能洗是怎么形成的谣言了&amp;hellip;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1966年的一条mint版本的Levis可以卖到20万日元，高昂的价格使得日本人开始生产复刻版&amp;hellip; 但也有人认为太没有原创精神了。YAMANE设计了Evisu.（标记也是levis的变形），特征是海鸥标记和后代很花的刺绣。（终于知道初中时朋友穿的牛仔裤是什么牌子了&amp;hellip;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另外也有人不喜欢大家追逐名牌，而背离了牛仔裤耐用好穿的本质，创建了毫无修饰的Kapital和Tuki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ Harada is tired of all the “storytelling” in men’s apparel: “I hate when there is too much emphasis on the ‘story’ in clothing. People should wake up and want to put on my pants because they feel great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten: Exporting Ametora&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;优衣库的创始者Tadashi Yanai的父亲是Van的特许经营者，Van倒闭给了他不少启示。1985年，他在广岛开了一家买基础款的大型自选商店Unique Clothing Warehouse，缩写就是Uniqlo。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还讲了当今欧美时尚如果想设计ivy和trad(traditional)风格的衣服，会参考学习日本资料。作者认为Thom Browne就是例子之一。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书中有两则好笑的小事。当van公司的人去美国拍电影，问耶鲁学生“你穿短裤是因为它们很流行吗？”答“我从来没想过这个，只是我洗完后它们缩水了。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当一位沉迷于重工系产品的日本人去阿拉斯加旅行“我从头到脚穿着美国遗产品牌，1955年的李维斯，二战时期的风格，你能找到的最稀有的紅翼鞋。但没有一个人在乎。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这不是说西方人都不太会穿，但日本人是格外在乎穿吧，还有极度的恋物癖。Popeye的作者在后来甚至说后悔给供稿“Popeye扳动了日本物质主义泡沫的扳机。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我理解那么年轻人通过服装作为自我表达的方式，个人观察，目前已经和难有整个社会影响的服装潮流了，大家都能在各自细分的风格中遨游。护肤品和化妆品取代了服装成为社交话题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在东南亚背包旅行时遇到很多欧美背包客，大家就T恤衬衫牛仔裤卡其裤，自由自在，也没谁看不起谁。下水男的就穿条短裤女的就比基尼甚至裸泳，对身体放松的态度我还挺羡慕的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过我想，不管是音乐风格、服饰风格、数码装备、茶叶咖啡，每个时代每个人都能找到最适合自己的的恋物癖。。六十年代，就有专栏作家批评，年轻人买东西不是为了新的体验，买CD机为了听爵士乐，买西装为了追女孩，买登山包为了徒步。他们只是迷恋物品本身。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我对物质的祛魅是看到那么多用徕卡的人拍出的照片非常丑&amp;hellip; 相对于花钱买相机，把更多的预算给旅行，去更多的地方，花费更多的时间拍照。 Buy experience, not things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在某些方面挺欣赏日本人，日料、日系服装、日本设计（审美上的民艺运动）都是近代才发展出来的产物，他们吸收欧美元素，通过整合加入日本元素，形成了具有全球影响力的日本风格。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;记得曾经看到过，有人问村上春树，为什么他的小说中有这么多的西方品牌。村上说“因为在我看来可口可乐就是可口可乐，而不是某种碳酸饮料。”（绝对不是原话）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comme des Garçons Homme的设计师Junya Watanabe说“西方服饰是我们的日常服装，我不认为这有什么不同，不管你是日本人还是美国人还是欧洲人。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用平和的态度接受外来文化，汲取养分，勇敢挪用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为一个不怎么穿着打扮的人，读这本书的快乐在于经常会有种“哦哦哦哦”的感觉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;疯投圈最新一期《新消费品牌崛起大时代》里把消费品分为三类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一类是靠领先的产品，比如说苹果、戴森。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二类是靠性价比，比如说小米、优衣库。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第三类是靠用户体验和品牌形象，比如说星巴克、耐克。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一类和第三类的差别是如果苹果有年的产品不好，销售量就会很差。星巴克或者耐克出难喝的饮料或者不受欢迎的鞋，企业还是会生存下去。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我敬佩有创造力的设计师，它们设计出新的好的产品，理应获得高溢价。T恤一开始大家以为只能当内衣穿，不能穿在外面。一开始人们对紧身瑜伽服感到羞耻，Lululemon做到了让大家在瑜伽教室外穿瑜伽服。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其他公司再把产品普及推广给大众。所以我个人是最喜欢第二类品牌的，适当的价格，优质的产品，咖啡工具界的Hario，服装界的优衣库。没有帆布鞋、没有卡其裤、没有T恤，我会在穿什么上烦恼很多。&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;小時候學畢加索，最常說到的是“我花了四年时间画得像拉斐尔一样，但用一生的时间，才能像孩子一样画画。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;給大家看他11歲時畫的素描，15歲時畫的素描
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce49adbdebc394608.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study for a Torso ，1892&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce49b0b2415556615.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Communion，1896&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;長大後的畫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce49b5b4c75191992.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那時還不懂什麼藝術史，可能還信了最後要回到孩子的天真&amp;hellip;
现在的我来看，毕加索做的就是抛去先前“经典体系“的审美，做出了自己的创新，如果再早几个世纪，也有可能去搞印象派，不过是印象派也搞过了，后面还搞过七七八八的，就全解构了吧，是不是孩子的天真都无妨。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/post/step71_narrative/&#34;&gt;Step 71&lt;/a&gt;说“美是有定式的。所有去日本旅游的人拍出来的都是小清新（要么是另一种变种的清新），不需要修图软件，大脑里内藏了滤镜。 ”（自己引用自己）
早上看到Timothy发的 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/pin/1114408774538158080&#34;&gt;东京日常&lt;/a&gt; 脑子里就是&amp;quot;哈！&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce4a71bd9c5194833.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;东京日常&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce4a5f910ef480372.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;东京日常&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce4a607ce08596252.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;东京日常&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为接受过摄影学院教育的Timothy不可能不知道如何拍出传统意义的好照片。時代的弔詭之處是無法避免地有做同樣事情的人，比如我知道彭可是朋友说我有个和你同样放飞自我”的学妹“&amp;hellip; 所以我已经解构了快两年什么也没解构出来&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;无法创新和突破的原因之一是无法接受“粗糙”的审美。
浪漫化是“改变”现实表现真实的能力，解决如何浪漫化就是在形成风格&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chengxinhao.me&#34;&gt;程新皓&lt;/a&gt; 《来源不同的时间》 是国内至今看过的最有逻辑反思性的作品，似乎不仅做图片，还做影像创作了，6月到8月在深圳有个展&amp;hellip; 感觉可以为此跑一趟&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kepeng.org&#34;&gt;彭可&lt;/a&gt;  92年（危机意识） 《盐水池塘》关注的主题和我关注的重合度很高，也是四人中受西方学院派审美最终的&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>二零一八阅读总结（三）</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;以前挺少读英文原著的，去年开始读，导火线是年初读《海风中失落的血色馈赠》，在微博关注了译者陈以侃，推荐了不少小说，没有译本。再往深说一点是，前一两年和朋友就开始聊到中文世界里没有写现代都市生活境遇的作品，就去英文世界看看。比如看Ali Smith的《Autumn》是因为时间是脱欧后的英国诶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;翻译的确会丢失文本的气质和语感。今天在书店里也聊到，台湾中文的弹性比大陆好很多，去年写了篇相关的书评&lt;a href=&#34;https://book.douban.com/review/9408954/&#34;&gt;《方言小说与现代中文》&lt;/a&gt;。我平时SNS讲话，“好棒啊！真的&amp;hellip;.！太&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;了！” 很垃圾的中文，好的语言，会让人发呆吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年先读了略萨的《酒吧长谈》，然后读了两本福克纳。福克纳真的太牛逼了&amp;hellip; 牛逼在结构的控制力吧。曾经有个朋友聊天中谈及童年和少年往事，回来后笔记写了三千字，不是我记性好，是好的叙述者讲故事的能力，对读者获知信息整体的控制力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经济和金融去年主要是两块，一块是货币，主要是货币政策和货币创造和派生，对央行、银行在经济运行中起到的作用有了比较粗略的了解。一块是经济危机，亚洲金融危机、英镑危机、08金融危机相关的金融史。去年似乎对经济极其悲观，觉得经济形势很差，结果大规模的系统性危机一直没有发生诶，未来总是难以预测。BIS的论文蛮好的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;年前开始读了不少文化史和微观史，很难进入宏大叙事的语境，细节组成的历史的厚重感。大学后几年读文学作品读的很少，当时觉得有些过于煽情了（偏见吧），迷历史学、社会学、人类学，读多了又感觉非虚构作品看到的只是一种剖面，文学里许多细微之处也会让人发呆。只有一个剖面就只能得到一个剖面的触感。希望观看事物的视角是多样且复杂的，人类学社会学偏于逻辑和结构，文学更偏于个人史，个人和社会的互动性。
对我而言，最大的问题还是如何理解这个世界吧。&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;见过几次张君钢的作品，前几天samepaper发了组伊朗游记，顺手查了他的访谈。看到一篇10年的&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simple-style.com/interviews/chinese-photographer/k1973.html&#34;&gt;访谈&lt;/a&gt;，11年的&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.co-mag.net/cn/2011/chinese-li-jie-zhang-jungang/&#34;&gt;访谈&lt;/a&gt;。
感想是：你以为你拍摄的是时代，到最后你不过是时代的切片，就你能拍出的东西，往往受限于时代的审美。（btw，我还是挺欣赏张君钢，&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zhangjungang.com/84/84-10.html&#34;&gt;大桥及附近的风景&lt;/a&gt;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近观察到的艺术摄影的趋势是诗意和碎片化。快到千人一面的地步了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;微博上有几句讨论：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@芬尼根狂欢日: 毕赣这一代人，也就是我这一代人，一旦开始创作， 除了模仿各种图像以外真的很难做什么创新。不会。我们的作品难道是今天才变成各种大师的借鉴杂烩体吗?是一直以来就只会这样而已。能做到的这样的都是同龄人中的佼佼者了。因为我们就是活在图像世界里的一代人。文艺青年们看电影，就好像在图像世界里泛舟，看完了记住的除了影像还是影像，除了感觉还是感觉。哲学教育都是零，深度思考全不会。偶尔有些爱读书的，都擅长抽象思考，一旦落实于小说和戏剧，只会进行抽象表达，不会其他，所以我们拍的东西，都是抽象的人，没有具体的人。我们这一代人，就算是县城的孩子，又有多少县城经验?就算大城市的孩子，又有多少城市经验?我们本就是经验上乏善可陈的一代人。我们长到三十岁，真的懂中国吗?不懂的。我们是活在大学城里的一代人。除了食堂、宿舍、咖啡厅、图书馆、城乡结合部的小旅馆、地铁和商场以外，我们知道什么?我们对空间能有什么想象?没有的。真悲哀，我们这一代人。
@黄小邪在纽约:这非中国年轻人独有问题，是世界各国创作者面临的困境：经验的匮乏、感知思想的贫困。全球化资本主义消费方式令大家经验趋同。我一直在想对抗的方式，其一是旅行，可远可近，保持充足好奇心，观察和倾听不同的人与文化。前辈有徒步走村串户的经历。不沉迷手机、游戏、自拍这些不创造第一首手新经验的东西。希望大家不要误解，观察、体验并不一定要高消费跨国旅行，整个世界只有自我的人去了外星球也一样视而不见，真正的创作者则能够敏感地注意到窗外的鸟、地铁上的陌生人、小区楼下的树叶、公园的狗、广场晨练的老人、背书包上学的孩子、远近的市声……每天，四季，都有新鲜的经验，特别地领会，灵动到创作中。
@小郑爱吃枣：创作者阶级趋同也是问题&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我喜欢的东西是有历史性和社会性的，比较关注的摄影师是李亚楠，在当下中国，想要表现历史性避不开政治性，但政治性语言和符号过于粗糙。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;过度诗意化、碎片化的风格在我看来如同生活在玻璃暖房，是不是有人的生活就是如此，还是自我编织了玻璃暖房的谎言？
我没法去拍棚户区的东西，也没法去拍过于边缘的边缘群体的东西。除了极度的符号化，细节也编织真实，但如今大多数人的现代生活已经没有具体的生活经验了，总有一段挂在虚拟世界里。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去一个城市拍下典型的风景名胜，是自我羞辱。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;美是有定式的。所有去日本旅游的人拍出来的都是小清新（要么是另一种变种的清新），不需要修图软件，大脑里内藏了滤镜。
审美的定式，思维的定式，如果社会身份对你而言是重要的，逐渐地，你穿什么衣服、住怎样的房子、吃怎样的东西、交怎样的朋友都会被无形的东西限制住。如果你做了不符合社会身份的事，你就会感到逾矩了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;无法创新和突破的原因之一是无法接受“粗糙”的审美。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;浪漫化是“改变”现实表现真实的能力，解决如何浪漫化就是在形成风格&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;之前说过&amp;quot;观察摄影史，经典照片/作品的趋势是：1. 单张的复杂程度逐渐变高（布列松-&amp;gt;Alex Webb），从单张作品到作品集。如何处理这些关系，既是技巧的，也是美学的。 2. 越来越从故事般的“叙事“变为诗歌般的“意象”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;同样是决定性瞬间，从布列松到alex webb，很明显可以看出单一元素到复杂元素，一二层到多层，单层元素的互动到多层元素的互动，逐渐流行的类似风格也佐证了答案是正确的。&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当时想的单张照片的复杂多层复杂元素的代表是Alex Webb。就很长一段时间，这是我对单张照片复杂度认知想象的极限。Gregory Crewdson那卦靠大尺度堆积细节不算。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f141ce410b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;看到知乎”摄影中照片的结构是什么？“问题下的答案，我才意识到照片还有立体维度。或者可能是我潜意识知道了，理性上不知道。这张16年偶然拍的照片，我一直很喜欢（拍过那么多张照片记住其中一张也挺不容易的） 昨天终于get the point了！某些信息会储存在大脑里 和未来某刻的信息发生连接&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f19a9d899b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2016-hongkong&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;马骥的答案里提到了Stephen Shore的“结构”和西方绘画传统中透视的关系
&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f19baa79e4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;claude&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude Lorrain, Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba, 1648&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f191de025c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f20e3d9285.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f23c8c4bab.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这使我想问“当代中国摄影是否受国画审美影响？”，答案是。国画看的太少，很难找到典型相似的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.loli.net/2019/01/16/5c3f17e2c7953.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同样是新地形摄影，同样是电线杆，张克纯也是很平面的&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一个玩的是透视，一个玩的是平面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前提到18年关注到的项目是：冯立的白夜（四星）、彭可的盐水池塘（三点五星），再补上雷宝珠（两点五星）和程新皓的来源不同的时间（time from different sources）（四点五星）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;冯立是五到十年前，雷宝珠是五到二十年前，彭可是当下，程新皓是永恒。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;彭可

&lt;p&gt;我想拍的：当下的，和人发生联结的，温柔但有力量的，存在刺你一下的东西。&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;在每天的起床、洗漱、迈出家门，走进街区，地铁站或停车场，吞咽食物中是否蕴含意义？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;无数电影小说发生着如此的叙事“我日复一日地过着同样的生活，直到厌倦。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比起旅行时的惊鸿一瞥，我更沉溺于日常生活的细节，失语于无数次黄昏时的一朵云。日常生活是身体性的。在广东时，饭后去小区里的湖边散步看日落，晚上在没有路灯的上上下下的林荫道上慢跑，夏季浓重的草木气味。在成都，下楼走五分钟去面包店买吐司作明日的早餐，清晨和老爷爷老奶奶一起逛菜市。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书的副标题还挺成功学的“How successful people start everyday inspired”  此书和另一本小书《Daily Rituals》还略有渊源，My Morning Routine网站上还收录了对作者Mason Curry的访谈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在Daily Rituals有不少的创作者推崇“日常工作比灵感更重要”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Faulkner说“I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day.”此理念的代表是村上春树，他每天早上四点起床，工作五到六个小时，九点睡觉。村上春树认为写作（特别是写长篇小说）是体力劳动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;村上还自嘲“而这种思维方式和生活方式，说不定与大众想象的小说家形象大相径庭。……住在安稳的郊外住宅区里、过着早睡早起的健康生活、日复一日地坚持慢跑、喜欢自己做蔬菜沙拉、钻进书房每天按部就班完成固定工作量的作家，只怕谁都不会渴望吧？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十九二十世纪的创作者，过着奇奇怪怪的生活，各种各样的副业。村上说人们印象中的作家“过着自甘堕落的生活，顾家庭于不顾，把夫人的衣物送进典当铺里还钱（马克思），有时沉湎于美酒（不止一个），有时沉湎于女人（不止一个），总之是随心所欲无所不为，从这样的颓废与混沌中催生出文学来的反社会文人——这样一种古典的小说家形象说不定才符合世间大众的期待。要不然就是那种向往参加西班牙内战、在炮火纷飞中劈劈啪啪敲击打自己的‘行动派作家’。（海明威）”（此段引用中的括号是我加的…）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;《苏菲的选择》的作者William Styron睡到中午，赖床读一小时书，知道下午四点才开始连续工作四小时（但只能写两百到三百字），吃完饭后会喝酒，抽烟，读书，听音乐到凌晨两三点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;副业开印刷厂、铸字厂，一天不知道喝多少咖啡的巴尔扎克，晚上六点吃饭，之后就去睡觉，一点爬起来写七个小时。早上八点小睡九十分钟，然后持续工作到四点（难怪他只活了51岁）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;卡夫卡每天只在晚上十一点才才开始工作，凌晨两三点睡觉，八点起床去上班——他先是在保险公司上班（中层职位），1908年跳槽去了布拉格工人意外事故保险机构（the Worker’s Accient Insurance Institute）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但如今，愈来愈多的人希望成为自律的创作者。相对于前两个世纪的创作者，现在的“成功人士”（包括自由职业者）比起hippie更像是stoic，早起（平均起床时间为6.26am，这个数据真是令我难以置信），早睡（平均睡觉时间是10:58pm）。早上喝的第一杯水无非是水、咖啡和茶。78%的人会锻炼，63%的人会冥想或做瑜伽。50%的人早餐会吃水果，其次是鸡蛋，燕麦。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先说说早起，在Daily Rituals中，大约三分之一左右是在七点前起床的，而在My Morning Routine中，七点前，80%以上的人已经起床了。这与当今睡眠状况调查的结果背道而驰。（中国90后年轻人，还有17.5%是早睡早起，30.9%晚睡早起，31.1%晚睡晚起。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二十世纪前的人们早起多是因为无从选择。美国作家Frances Trollope 53岁开始写作，她养育着六个孩子，只能四点写作到早餐时间。还有一堆作家全是四五点爬起来，就坐在书桌前写写写。Is waking up early the secret to a successful writer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二十一世纪早起为了躲避干扰。在风险投资行业工作的M. G. SIEGLER喜欢在人们不能立刻回复的时间发送邮件。在别人还没有起床时保持清醒，时间都是自己的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;现代资本主义社会，时间就是金钱。从人们对专业人士工作十多小时后还去健身房的刻板形象中，或许能得出，比起凯鲁亚克和嬉皮士，我们更喜欢，或者更愿意喜欢努力工作，自律，能控制欲望的人。（这和当代精英形象的变化相同，西莫斯·可汗在一本关于美国精英的研究中得出，精英从把自己作为一个凝聚的群体、一个有特别历史和品味的阶级，到把自己看作是美国最有天分和最努力的一群人。）我们把创作者从”天才”变成了”工匠”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;另一个原因是全球化（尤其是信息全球化），当代社会，充斥着各种关于“我是不是不够有生产力”，“如何提到效率”，再然后出了一堆时间管理、任务管理、精力管理的方法论书籍和app。任何一个有心去提高效率的人，都能得到相似的建议：要固定作息，坚持锻炼，合理饮食，珍惜与家人相处的时间。同质化是无可避免的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;反正读完了也依然无法早起，不过养成了新习惯，早饭时不看书不玩手机，和家人一起认认真真吃早饭。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>二零一八阅读总结（二）：中短篇小说集和摄影</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2018-reading-novel/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 10:51:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2018-reading-novel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“摄影它作为艺术媒介之一怎么做都好，关键是你提出了什么问题，你要做什么，这是最重要的。你用什么做真的不重要。因为现在当代艺术发展到今天已经很多元化了。对我而言，我更喜欢用我稍微擅长的方式表达，摄影它也是我说话的方式，我觉得说清楚了，就没必要让它更复杂，好比我已经说过一遍话了，就不想再赘述一遍。——张克纯”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不论何种艺术，似乎都有对外（客观世界）和对内（私人情绪）的不同去向，日本摄影既有深厚的纪实传统，也有“私写真”（中国摄影目前没看到任何对内拍的好的（任航可能是，但我不喜欢他😂））&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我是客观世界那一路的( ̀⌄ ́)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年和朋友谈话说“好的摄影项目是短篇小说集” 后来又看一句话“每个记者都会喜欢乔伊斯的《都柏林人》” 还有一句话是“my little airport的歌曲是香港当代都市文学”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这三句话说的是“体裁只是语言的一种” 图像、音乐、文字用不同的“语言”表达相似的东西。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前几年基本不读文学小说了（还读类型小说），一直也不怎么看电影&amp;hellip; 今年带着这样的想法，读了几部短篇小说集，包括买麦克劳德的《海风中失落的血色馈赠》（加拿大新斯科舍省）、奈保尔的《米格尔街》（英国）、门罗的《逃离》（加拿大）、舍伍德·安德森的《俄亥俄，温斯堡》（又名《小镇畸人〉）、吴明益的《天桥上的魔术师》不是今年读的同款还有乔伊斯的 《都柏林人》、白先勇的《纽约客》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;短片小说集和摄影项目最重要的相似点是：印象胜于逻辑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中国典型的现状：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;国内新晋摄影师，受Alec Soth和西方学院派影响太大了，很多摄影项目痕迹都很重。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“痕迹重”是个很有意思的感受。审美是多层次的，最前的一层是先验，越往后，后验的程度越深。先验是更身体偏情感的，后验是更逻辑偏理性的。他们的后验很完整，先验看不到，或者几乎没有，或者同质化严重（那种“轻盈、浪漫、缄默、破碎”）。同样类似的题材，豆瓣上的雷宝珠表达出的共情远甚于一般。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;引用友邻KREJERK说的话&amp;quot;叙事手法和那些个trick并不会让一部电影变成经典，现在你再提搏击俱乐部和低俗小说会聊它们的结构么？这些东西是最容易被学习被超越也最容易过时的东西，它不是一部电影变成经典的原因，气味才是 你现在再看爱情是狗娘肯定不会觉得这种剧本结构有啥可稀奇的，最好的还是穿着拖鞋走过墨西哥城肮脏小巷和地下狗场那股血淋淋汗津津的味道，这才是这部电影完全没办法模仿到的东西&amp;quot; 先验比后验更重要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;观察中国摄影已经成名的摄影师（吕楠）素材多是乡土、偏远地区、少数群体，目前正在进行的是县城和西部地区（川渝），现代都市生活、消费文化仍是空白。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年关注到的项目是：冯立的白夜（四星）、彭可的盐水池塘（三点五星）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;观察摄影史，经典照片/作品的趋势是：1. 单张的复杂程度逐渐变高（布列松-&amp;gt;Alex Webb），从单张作品到作品集。如何处理这些关系，既是技巧的，也是美学的。 2. 越来越从故事般的“叙事“变为诗歌般的“意象”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年没拍什么照片，也没有摄影计划，重新整理个站，关注的问题是：一个项目中不同照片间的关系，空间关系（前后、上下排列）对叙事的影响，组图中单张照片和整体主题的关系，图像如诗歌的韵律。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我个人认为摄影是你要去表达一个东西（想法）， 单张照片已经没法做到完整地表达 也不够complicated。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“对它是什么有基本概念” 为什么要强调“基本概念” 只要知道历史上别人已经做了什么工作 还有什么工作需要去做 同时代的人在做什么 你才知道自己要解决的新问题是什么 只有解决新问题 创造新观念 才能推动共同体的发展&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年最爱Stephen Shore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>二零一八阅读总结（一）：茶叶</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2018-reading-tea/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 10:46:36 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2018-reading-tea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;近两年（集中在近一年）茶叶相关的书读的较多，可分为三类：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一是茶叶作为植物和茶叶技术作为工艺的物质层面：如种植环境、茶树栽培、茶叶品种、制作工艺、茶具、泡茶手法等等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二是与茶相关的社会文化：如日本的茶道、英国的下午茶、国内天南地北的茶馆、台湾的茶艺师以及此中衍生出的社交规范、审美偏好、公共空间。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第三是茶叶作为一种经济作物——交易的商品在世界范围内的传播和深入其中扮演重要角色的经济和政治文化事件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是个人理解的框架，如果以后对咖啡或者其他相似食物感兴趣估计也是这样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一类我读的少，也没遇到特别好的，书店里“生活方式”书架上茶相关的书十本九本装逼的。更多是在生活中多尝试不同工艺、不同品种、不同地区的茶叶。国内的红茶、绿茶、乌龙茶、黑茶。安徽福建云南四川。印度大吉岭，斯里兰卡锡兰，南非博士茶，香港鸳鸯奶茶。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第二类唯一感兴趣的是公共空间，探访了成都和重庆的几个老式茶馆，但没遇到有融入当代生活的案例。另一种饮品咖啡倒已经发展出相当规模的社群文化，我最喜欢的当然是社区店啦 &amp;gt; &amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;讨论这类公共空间的学术书只找到Ray Oldenburg的《The great good place》，里面讨论了法国的咖啡店，书店，酒吧，理发店作为区别于第一空间（家庭）、第二空间（工作地点）的第三空间在社区关系的构建中发挥的作用。（想起来mark这本书是17年去越南玩看到他们那边社区咖啡馆挺有意思，在国内受朋友影响窜了些馆子……结果后来都在喝茶😂）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第三类零零散散的，自己的阅读路径出于偶然，主要由英国植物学家Robert Fortune串起。一七年年中开始读Sarah Rose的《From all the tea in China》（中译名《茶叶大盗》）讲述Fortune多次来华移植茶树到印度地区。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;跟着Fortune又读了他在安徽和武夷地区的游记《两访中国茶乡》，该书开篇是坐船到香港，里面提到的香港植物园，让我第一次意识到即使看似非常自然的植物传播，背后是国家力量。然后去读了《清代英国在华的博物学家》，当时在广东参观了佛山清晖园。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;更一条线是出于对成都和城市研究的兴趣读了王笛的《茶馆：成都的公共生活和微观世界，1900-1950》，也是这本书使我在选择宜居重庆或成都的摇摆中选择了后者。这本加上王笛的《跨出封闭的世界》、《街头文化》还有早几年读的王明珂的写川西北羌藏地区的《羌在汉藏之间》形成了我对长江上游地区的基本理解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;依旧是长江中上游地区，读了王笛老师罗威廉的两本《汉口》，《汉口》中很大篇幅写汉口作为长江中上游的转口贸易城市，茶叶在其中的地位。（现在四川和湖南茶叶在全国没什么名声&amp;hellip;）。顺便读了曾小萍所著写四川自贡地区近代制盐业发展的《自贡商人》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;反正是出于兴趣的瞎读，目前最喜欢喝武夷岩茶、凤凰单丛、云南红茶，明年希望能遇到写西部、西北茶叶贸易，再抽空去下武夷山、凤凰山！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读过的几本通史都一般。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>方言小說與現代中文</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/modern_chinese_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 17:19:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/modern_chinese_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;我是何時發現自己中文變差了？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;從在網上隨意發言的用語越來越冗長和軟弱；從可以用口語把觀點表達清楚，卻總是逃避寫，從要克制才能不頻繁地使用“感覺、其實、非常、真的、都、太、現在、已經”。（評論：“太對了，感覺這種詞其實真的不好，現在都已經非常介意自己說這些了。”）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有意識地觀察每天看到的中文後，我發現，普遍而言，大家的中文都變差了（微信公眾號體，互聯網上的評論發言）。長居海外的華人，看到的爛中文少一些，或許是幸運。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二十世紀上半葉， 中國知識界曾展開關於中文的大討論，包括是否廢除漢字（即中文的拉丁化），白話文運動，普通話和方言的關係等等等等⋯⋯一個無法忽視的背景，當時也是中國近代國家觀念形成的時期。“語言各含國性以成名”（黃錦樹，p28）此中涉及的，中國是多民族國家，漢語和少數民族語言的關係，漢語等同“國語”、“中文”的影響在本文中暫且不表。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如今仍有討論意義的問題：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;普通話與方言的關係&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;書面語與口語的關係&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大陸中文和境外中文的關係&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中文與外文的關係&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;現代中文的面貌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中國古代，書面語和口頭語是區隔的，白話文運動推動了口語“文”化。漢語語言學家一般把漢語分為官話、吳語、湘語、贛語、客家話、閩語與粵語等七大方言，大略分為北方官話、晉語、下江官話、西南官話。其他六種方言使用人口各占2%至8%不等。（黃錦樹，p47）其他方言由於長期的政治邊緣化，地理的阻隔，互相之間難以轉譯，書面話經驗欠缺難以成文。他們選擇了多數人使用的“優勢語言”（官話）作為國語，在文學上造就了一個“失語的南方”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;黃錦樹評價“胡適的國語計畫明顯是借用多數人使用的「優勢語言」，把中國廣大幅員裡官話系統以外分歧的方言，儘管它也是「活的語言」——時間當下生活世界的語言——存而不論。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;各地的近代國家將漢語、拉丁語等語言向俗語翻譯過程中，形成了新的語言。日本在明治時代以口語為基礎重新創制了新的書寫語言，實際上是由小說家（文學）來實現的。甲午戰後，大量前往日本留學的年輕中國學生學習了“文言一致”，在中國發起了同樣的事情。（柄谷行人，2005)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在白話文中的國語方案中，胡適雲“我們所提倡的文學革命，只是要替中國創造一種國語的文學。有個國語的文學，方才可有文學的國語。有了文學的國語，我們的國語才可算得真正國語。國語沒有文學，便沒有生命，便沒有價值，便不能成立，便不能發達。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;方言小說回應的是把口語“文”化的問題，是對“失語的南方”的抵抗。前幾年非常火的《繁花》，敘事時間為二十世紀的六十年代至九十年代。這好比武俠小說所設定的時間截至到民國初年，兩者都構建了一個未被（相對）現代化變遷所改變的世界，“銘刻了一代世俗大眾的懷舊”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;很多人開始關注方言保護，為方言丟失感到悲觀，側面表說明當下面對的新情境是口語的瀕危。以前只是在書面語上失語，如今在口語上也要成為化石了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;李如一對於方言的丟失的判斷標準是：一個表現是不知道如何用方言表達新事物”。在這一標準下，他認為香港人的粵語是母語，大陸方言者的方言不是母語，“香港人可以用粵語表達各種現代、以及同時代（contemporary）概念和思想，大陸方言使用者——包括廣東地區的粵語使用者——不行。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他的解決方案是“擁抱帶方言口音的英文。堅持用自然地將英文融入上海話，堅持用滬語口音說英文，例如「一道去Starbucks吃咖啡」裏的Starbucks用徹底的上海口音讀，以奇為潮，以怪為美，讓英文詞彙成為上海方言的一部分，就不存在方言丟失的問題了。日語利用片假名和日語發音規則轉化大量外來語，是同樣的路徑。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;年初那會，我特別想看描寫當代都市生活，能夠處理時代病症，準確把握時代精神的文學作品，腦子裡想的是白先勇的《台北人》、喬伊斯的《都柏林人》。和朋友討論了一圈，沒有。老一輩的作家都是寫農村生活，或者城市的古早記憶，年輕的作家要麼不太是純文學，或者是實力未到，寫得多是小鎮生活或者都市青春文學。
劉濤對合肥街道的攝影啟發了我，即使不是北上廣深，只是三四五六七八線城市，也有現代化生活，也有新的可以處理的素材。《空響炮》中的世界，是小城市平民階層的熟人社會。但《美芬的故事》中的美芬，要面臨年老後的獨居，女兒移居香港，結婚不辦婚禮，堅持丁克；《空響炮》裡的喜舖批發街，因為禁炮令，炮仗店生意到頭。中國並沒有從小在現代都市長大的人，所有人都或多或少被襲捲進城市化和全球化的浪潮。他們是“過去”的故事，也是這個時代的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;中國古代社會有一種神奇的救濟機構：惜字局。收集寫過的紙張，放進惜字爐，鄭重其事地燒掉，表達對文字的尊敬。而今對文字有敬畏的人，看著爐子裡的蠶紙，一閃一滅逐漸消失。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;還是有點想看人寫《一道去Starbucks吃咖啡》。&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;吃完晚饭后出门，缘由是听《味之道》里的主播，成都人席妙雅说，成都的酒吧有个神奇的地方是，你可以在酒吧里点任何你想吃的东西吃，而成都最老的酒吧街——九眼桥，附近的卤菜都被一家“胖妈卤菜”垄断了，席妙雅曾经和朋友为了这家的卤菜进一间酒吧，点完酒后没有铺垫直接说“老板我饿了想吃点夜宵”，然后点了那家的兔腰子和兔肚，吃得大满足。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;先用apple地图查，找不到，大众点评上倒是有，地址是“九眼桥丝管街1812bar门口”，豆瓣小组有个07年的帖子说“九眼桥河边，每到晚上八点，有个小摊摊就摆出来了”，今天去的时候是后面紧靠着酒吧，露天有个店面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/FullSizeRender%204.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我记不住好吃的餐厅名字，可能也没法称作餐厅，独自旅行时习惯到了饭点就找附近最忙的馆子，通常都在街上，名字也都土土的，东南亚甚至是没名没号的档口，一头撞进去，用手指指隔壁桌看起来好吃的菜肴，付账买单。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;刚到广东时，和朋友住在一起，要确定早饭吃什么，先是把周边十几家都尝试了一遍，最后达成共识，某家的生滚粥好吃，但肠粉一般，另一家的肠粉好吃，但粥很一般，所以隔天换着吃，吃了整整一天。两家店名都很朴实（难记），可能是叫肠来吃、X记之类的。在广东吃到很多好吃的东西，有红枣粒的牛肉煲仔饭，叉烧烧鹅，烤乳鸽，白灼牛肉，但也很难记住是在叫什么名字的店里吃的。最夸张的一次是朋友要吃一家煲仔饭，讨论了五家店也不确定到底是哪家，最后都开始画陈设的平面图了………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一边记性很差，一边又对好吃的记忆深刻，即使没有地址到了附近也能找到餐厅。去年重游越南，到河内的第一天就去了四年前吃过超好吃的水果酸奶，那家店在大教堂附近，没有招牌，也没有英文菜单，店主不会英文，我不会越南语，但每次都能神奇地点单成功。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;食物是带不走的，食物的记忆和周围的环境鲜活地生活在一起，想无名档口的海鲜捞檬，鹅肉河粉，越南法棍三明治。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;挺多年前，在泰国市中心东急的饮食区，遇到个日本老爷爷，目测70岁上下，或许更老。是能看到年迈侵蚀的老，但打扮得很整齐，一个人一张桌子，吃一条鱼和一份饭。食物于我，是在我独自一人时陪伴我，给过我慰藉的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但近些年，食物越来越重要，是在于与他人的联结。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人生最开心的事排行榜，前十中一定有一件是：吃到好吃的，惊叹一句“好好吃啊”，闭上嘴品尝食物，看到对面的朋友也眼角扬起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;某个朋友是在我对日料的认知只有拉面、刺身和寿司时，带我第一次吃大阪烧的人，他还带我去小北，第一次在穆斯林餐厅吃羊肉串。另一个朋友曾提起，年少时某次她来我家，我给她做了好吃的蔬菜粥（难以置信…）。弟弟曾经夸我做的凉拌皮蛋豆腐好吃（在家唯一做过的菜…）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我爸最以为傲的一道拿手菜是牛肉面，做法倒是很简单，菜场现买的牛肉切块，放高压锅里炖煮，另外一锅下手擀的面或者面皮，最后烫点蔬菜，淋上汤头。这次过年回家，发现，每次我回来的第一天的第一顿，一定是我爸做的牛肉面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;似乎有研究说，每个人的味觉都是不一样的，每个人的味觉随着时间、经历都会有所变化，我是深有体会，自己的舌头、饮食习惯和年少时的差异。中学时期，早饭都是一碗白粥，我不喜欢腌渍菜，所以妈妈每天早上都会先炒个蔬菜或者蛋。而最近好多个月一尘不变的的早餐食谱是一片烤吐司、一杯牛奶、一根香蕉。还有是，第一次到广州去银记喝粥，觉得好好吃好好吃，后来在佛山吃了几个月，返广州同一家店同一样粥，吃了两口就走了…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;味蕾的变化就如同人本身的变化，没法控制它不变，也预料不到它怎么变，但回忆啊，能让人明白过去是怎样的，什么是重要的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年夏天让弟弟来广东找我玩，带他吃了不少自己喜欢的食物，过年回家偶尔提起当时的事，很多我都忘了，他却都还记得，抱怨说“你怎么都不记得了”。我说“对你是特别的经历，对我是日常啊。”但还挺开心的，要尽力给在乎的人创造美好的回忆。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;吃得开心是很幸运的能力吧，提着一袋兔肚和兔腰子回家的我，自然是很开心的。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life is a miracle</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/life_is_a_miracle/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2018 16:03:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/life_is_a_miracle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;看了十三邀采访李诞那期，一些想法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十四年前后，我是个热衷吐槽，常被人评价毒舌。当时说“吐槽是一个人聪明才智的溢出”，“吐槽是我的被动技能”。很久没吐槽了，可能也没以前机智了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;吐槽是批评的一种，批评的对象是人，戏谑的吐槽并不能促进双方的沟通。批评的对象是社会或外在事物，吐槽不能推进讨论，即使提出的是真问题。相对于赞扬，批评把批评者置于杯批评者更高的地位，批评要更严肃的批评，觉得什么东西不好/不对，就要说清楚为什么不好/不对。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近几年和同龄人接触，有两类人有明显的群体特征。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一类是“连忧愁都很轻盈的”，他们没有需要寻找自身存在感的焦虑，也没有被一些问题所纠缠，他们的内核是“空”的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有一类是“什么都无意义”，没有对错，什么都可以。一六年他们是“丧”青年，一七年是“佛系”青年。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他们解构一切。（需要一些论据加强论点&amp;hellip;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;福柯说“在一个不再承认任何神圣事物的积极意义的世界里亵渎神灵——这是不是有点像我们所称的越界行为？”我们知道了那些限制是由我们自己设定的，因此超越它们（越界）只能意味着对自己的反叛，借由“一种空洞的、转而向内的渎神，其介质只是在互相之间发生作用而没有任何外在的目标。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这也是许知远说的“他们这一代人的笑或者胡扯，不是那种扩张性的、延展性的，它反而是收缩性的。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;什么是“扩张性的”？淡豹在一篇谈小说《我的前半生》和《两个严肃的女人》的文章里批评《我的前半生》中，女主最后找了个“配得上”的对象，但《两个严肃的女人》中，“主角不是让后半生以新形式去复制前半生，而是放弃前半生曾经承认服从或者内心质疑但没有勇气在生活中挑战的那些价值，走异路逃异地，去见识别样的人们，放弃身体，和污秽和新鲜在一起，无论如何。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这些行为的策略是反抗，反抗像是青春期叛逆的延长，站在对立面还是被原先的东西限制住了，你依然不知道自己要追求什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我从极端的婚姻反对者变成温和的婚姻反对者，原因不是我开始向往婚姻，也没有改变我对婚姻的看法，而是我相信作为个体可以在社会提供的阐释之外重新赋予符号意义，包括婚姻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“唯一可以对抗强大国家与政治的，就是渺小却完整的自我。——罗新”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;曾经和一个朋友谈叙事，他质疑传统叙事的因果性。比如说，有一天你出门了，看到很多东西，然后遇到了一个朋友，等你写日记时，你会写“我今天出门，然后遇到了一个朋友。”所有的因果性都是后视的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“如果我今天出门时约了朋友见面，那因果性时存在的。”“但为了叙述你和朋友见面，你选择了一些信息，忽略了另一些信息。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;柯文在《历史三调》中把历史分为事件、经历和神话。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“对历史学家来说，人们的实际经历也许是杂乱无章、头绪繁多的，但对经历者而言，情况并非如此。人们的生活中并非没有混乱和无序，但是，我们的生活对我们而言却不是杂乱无章的。就个人的亲身经历来说，叙事功能是非常重要的。在日常生活中，我们本能地把经历与叙事联系在一起。我们给自己‘讲故事’，使我们的经历变得有意义：个人生平方面的意义而非历史方面的意义。因而，书籍解释生活中发生之事的说法并不完全正确。在生活中，我们也特别需要理解和解释我们每一天的经历。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我第一次在西贡玩时，白天到处晃悠拍了一棵树。三年后，重游西贡在午夜的街头，又遇见了那棵树。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近重听一些多年前爱的乐队，包括kings of convenience，发现网易和虾米上最新的专辑是09年，评论说没有解散，在北欧的酒吧和live house有演出，但不开演唱会，新歌写了也不录，简直逼人把它加入有生之年一定要听现场清单。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果未来某一天，我听了KOC的现场演出，那就是把过去和当下的自己连接起来的时刻，即使时间一去不复，个体在社会中越来越塌缩成孤独的粒子，也可以在自己身上实现叙事的连续性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>一七年小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/notes_of_2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 15:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/notes_of_2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/2913d48ea31d602.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TITLE&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年一月的感受是“最好把所有的输入渠道都‘调教’成可流动的状态，大概的意思是社交上想要认识新朋友，渠道abc有一些备选，也会有些新的人加入；信息上控制信息源，关注的话题肯定有，另外也会时不时出现一些没接触的概念、问题。以此逐渐延伸自己的触角。”过了一年，这个想法依然持续。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;成长过程受互联网影响很深，五六月份意识到自己和世界的接口太多了（包括各种社交网站 通信方式）。有意识地控制自己说什么，不说什么，废弃了一些接口。现在出门，就是强制offline，不听歌不上网。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用时间管理的方式建立日常生活是受大环境影响的，如果出生在另一个时代/另一种文明的平行世界，实现同样目标的方式或许会截然不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读了120多本书，除去画册、摄影集、食谱，只有110本，其中非虚拟和虚拟各占55本。
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Picture2.png&#34; alt=&#34;book&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读了不少历史，读历史于我，还是为了理解现在。布罗代尔说“刚刚过去的过去和多多少少遥远的过去合在一起构成了现在的多重性。新近的历史以高速度向我们冲来，更早一些的历史则以较为缓慢的速度、较为隐秘的方式伴随着我们。”更趋于专题阅读，去年两个大头分别是：长江中上游地区近代史、以茶叶为线索的传播和交流史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul A. Cohen, 历史三调&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王笛, 茶馆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王笛, 街头文化&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe, 红雨: 一个中国县域七个世纪的暴力史&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe, 汉口: 一个中国城市的冲突和社区(1796-1895)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe	, 汉口: 一个中国城市的商业和社会（1796-1889）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernest Borschmann	, 西洋镜：一个德国建筑师眼中的中国1906—1909&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;何智亚, 四川古镇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Fortune	, 两访中国茶乡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;陈慈玉, 生津解渴: 中国茶叶的全球化&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可以把书中的小说单独拎出来，小说的本质是讲故事，电影也是，叙事强的游戏也是。这三类属于可互相替代的文化消费品。小说读的越来越少，可电影看了很多，对故事的需求就满足了。跟去年比，今年玩了几个游戏，会关注的有两类： a.玩法独特的小游戏，像frame，gorogoa, b. 叙事性强的，玩游戏的过程像看电影 her story，life is strange。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;影像（包括电影、图片、游戏画面）讲故事的优势在于浸入感和感官体验，理性思考还得靠承载逻辑的语言（文字），流程图和示意图是特殊的图像。看历史片 图像上呈现的服饰，也得转化成“xx年代某某地的人穿xx样式的衣服”才能成为脑中的认知。游戏除了控制角色/可以选择带来的浸入感外，还能提供更多的文本（对话、书籍/纸张上的文字、物体间的关系、属性/技能/参数），解谜的过程涉及更多的思考。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没去太多地方，虽然大大小小旅行加起来也有50多天，主要就是在广佛地区、川渝地区周边跑，还去了趟越南。（每年跑三个区域）没那么喜欢出去玩了，认为拍照成为旅行的主要内容是偷懒地代替了思考，不拍标志性建筑/符号，是一种审美判断。去越南虽是破罐子破摔式出行，但遭遇还不错，有两个人至今印象清晰。在西贡认出了一棵树，三年前是白天，这次是深夜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;广佛地区
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-02%20at%208.12.57%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;川渝地区
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Picture3.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;越南&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-02%20at%208.12.42%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影是一种简单易取得信息的方式，你可以用流程化粗暴的方式处理不同的素材，而对被拍摄的物体几乎没有认知。随着技术的进步，可以分割画面中的元素，但拍摄是能获取的只有整块。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;认知的变化：传统和现代不是对立的，现代化是一个连续的过程，新旧不是拿来刻意对比的。就像一座城墙，伫立了很多年，从剖面看，不同时期用了不同的建筑材料和工艺，能明显看出变化和区分，但它依然是一个整体。这个变化也是有脉络的，社会也是这样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;建筑无古今之分，一切历史建筑它们设计之初，所面对的语境是一样的。好的建筑具有时间连续性和空间连续性，时间连续性是历代更替时修修补补到今天，空间连续性是它们总是和社区、周边的自然环境紧密融合在一起，不仅仅是单一建筑的设计，而是场所空间的设计。”（豆瓣心匠）拍老建筑不是为了怀旧，还是喜欢老建筑，但要处理更当代的素材。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;找到了新的观看的角度，也重新看到想拍的东西，但没有找到自己的视觉语言。当年无意识的街拍，是确信有和别人不一样的东西，对于新的素材，还没有找到 ，暂时采取不处理的方式，对此不是很满意。想要拍有history resonance和复杂性的东西。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果有一个存在称为“谜”，用语言接近它已经到达语言的极限，毕竟语言是一种框架，框架意为某种程度的限制，那就用图像去接近它。时间不可逆，摄影是最好的，当代研究。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;承认自己很不能写，或者说已经不擅长用文字来表达，更擅长谈话，很多思路都是在谈话中清晰的。中文退步的很快，第一次用历史的角度看现代汉语（以前只有文言文、半文言、白话文的概念），受两篇文章的影响较大：李陀《汪曾祺鱼现代汉语写作——兼谈毛文体》、陈力卫《汉语欧化过程中的日语因素》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;私人写作和公共写作是分开的，不那么爱谈自己了，公共写作又没什么能提供有价值观点的领域，表达欲就降低了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流行通信，第58期，嘉宾是阿角，说15年自己是个完整的人，现在是个残缺的人。人如果把自己打开，就会被人践踏，被一些事所伤害，就被打碎了。一月和五月完全碎成了渣，整个后半年全在日常生活和独处中疗愈，目前是个相对完整的人。其实完整久了自己就会找事情被打碎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人生最我来说最值得期待的不是自己会做什么事，去什么地方（通常这些我会有计划，太长期的无法预见但两三年总可以），而是内在的变化（性格 、思维方式），当事物给予刺激时，无意识的反应，目前为止每年都不一样。要内观，受到某个刺激，要知道自己行为的缘起，对自己的决定有所洞察。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前说过:如果驾驶一辆列车,对方行来一辆列车,我是会加速撞上去的那种人（类比在生活中是如果有个小矛盾,我会把它激化&amp;hellip; 然后摊牌解决）现在第一想的是:如果立刻踩刹车，不撞的可能性多大；如果撞了如何减小冲击力，降低负面影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人事上难过的多，给予安慰的都是老朋友。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;代办事项永远做不完，书永远读不完，一个疑惑解决了总有新的疑惑，完整久了又想被打碎，希望平静中有力量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>谈谈“任务管理和时间管理”</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/time_management/</link>

      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/time_management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;单纯的”任务管理和时间管理“十有八九是失败的，还得有配套的身体管理和精力管理，以及减少外界和他人的干扰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;0想清楚你生活中最需要你投入时间和精力的事情领域是什么&#34;&gt;0.想清楚你生活中最需要你投入时间和精力的事情/领域是什么&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;11-狭义的任务管理包括计划执行回顾&#34;&gt;1.1 狭义的任务管理包括计划、执行、回顾&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;工具和方法重要但并不那么重要 也有太多的书告诉你用什么方法《高效人士的7个blahblah习惯》《番茄工作法》等等等等，软件也是多的爆炸（番茄钟就有无数个…最全面的任务管理工具ominifocus，todist，2to）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;时间尺度分为日、周、月，回顾最小也得是周/双周级别的（我是计划和执行都是日月周）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;计划最重要的是细分、可执行&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get time scheduled：划定每天什么时候做什么，不需要绝对精确 ，我的主业工作时间是九点到十二点，中间是吃饭、午睡、阅读，下午三点到六点第二块工作时间，晚上就是阅读、运动、回顾、和人聊天，做一些不怎么需要动脑子的事，最重要的是保证每天六个小时做的事情是有生产力的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每周至少休息一天，那一天什么正事都不做（出去爬山，和朋友见面，逛博物馆，打游戏，喝酒都行，爱干嘛就干嘛）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;每年设置一些目标：工作日多少天，假期多少天，旅行多少天，朋友多少天，亲人多少天&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;122-时间记录&#34;&gt;1.2.2 时间记录&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;li&gt;工作日不要吃高淀粉高糖高油脂的食物（特别是中午） 容易困乏 适度饮酒（每周六）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舒适的工作环境
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;减少干扰物（工作区域只有和工作有关的物品，把手机放在房间外）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;适宜的温度、光线（晚上把屏幕调成暖色温f.lux）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舒适的工作姿势（椅子、把笔记本架起来，外接屏幕）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;关闭所有手机和电脑不紧急的notifications（我除了电话、闹钟和due全关了&amp;hellip;常年静音，除非出门玩or知道有人要联系我）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;工作时间把所有社交网站和娱乐网站都block了（&lt;a href=&#34;https://heyfocus.com&#34;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt;）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;减少不必要的聊天 每天划定时间回复消息（我是每晚十一点点到十二点，写日记顺手，加那个时候我已经没有脑子了&amp;hellip;）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;尽量减少无用的社交（社交真的很费时间 人是依靠成就和品格赢得别人的尊重 不是靠认识谁谁谁（工作就是靠认识谁谁谁的当我没说）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;亲人和朋友是很珍贵的 每年计划一些时间和他们一起度过 定期（按季度算）联系 在他们真的需要你的时候 应该在那里&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;平铺直叙的叙事&#34;&gt;平铺直叙的叙事&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;法国电影《心房客》 一幢居民楼的电梯坏了 大伙集资换电梯 二楼的秃头大叔从不坐电梯 不愿付钱 大伙同意他不出份子钱但也没权利使用电梯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;新电梯装好的第二天 他腿受伤坐上了轮椅 家里的冰箱空了 怕被楼里的人发现 整个白天从门缝里暗中观察大家的出行时间 黎明前下楼去菜场 可惜菜场没开门啊 去医院的自动售卖机买薯片和饼干 结果香肠卡住了 敲了几下还是卡在那里 大叔就哭了&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为一些小事而崩溃的人 往往不是过于脆弱 只是被最后一根稻草压死的骆驼
下午拆快递 一失手杯子就掉地上摔碎了 如果是电影 我应该已经蹲着哭了起来 并没有 因为杯子是买茶叶卖家送的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;摄影和旅行者&#34;&gt;摄影和旅行者&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影的本质是记录，再者是表达，当我们拍摄旅行中的事物，人应该是容器，一些东西流进来，过滤和转化之后，一些新的东西出现了，那不是占有和损害（我承认事实上拍摄对现实具有力的作用），自己（对于自己）是重要的，（对于世界）是不重要的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我们自拍，特别是在世界各地自拍，或者和世界各地的人自拍，就像把所有东西当成衣服或者首饰，将它们穿戴在身上，最后说“我好不好看”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;护照体现的不平等是事实，但护照更多的是为了防止人们获得平等的就业、长期迁移的权利，而不是反对消费性质的旅游。我们可以为了我们不付出任何努力就获得了比别人优势的地位而愧疚，但无需为了拥有每个人应当拥有的权利感到可耻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在当代，坐标具有更高的阶级性，人们会在简介上写 New Yorker, Hong Konger, based in Shanghai，旅行者（或者我想说的是没有固定坐标的人）在消解这种阶级性。但事实或许是，那些居住在超级大城市的人和有“能力”频繁穿梭的人高度重合。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我很少评价旅行中遇到的，我对他们的生活感到好奇，偶尔想拥有他们的街道、公园、城市还有日落，但我并不关心他们，和他们之间也不存在情感上的联结。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;成都&#34;&gt;成都&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;成都城市体量不大，一环直径九公里，二环十七公里，三环二十六公里。南边到天府新城都是发展起来的办公和住宅，高新区很多金融和高新技术企业，于是有很多需要租房的年轻人，金融城到广都地铁沿线几乎全是新开的品牌开发商楼盘。东边基本没开发，我下午在春熙路牛市口（市中心）附近，随便找了个附近的电影院，万象城里，往东两公里，就完全是新城的感觉了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;房价不高，一万两万左右，市区老小区套二在1500-2000左右（如果合租，单人租金压力就在700-1000之间），新小区套一2000左右，套二3000左右，高新区的租房价格较高，没什么生活设施和餐饮，有好几个年轻人几句话的交流就抱怨过住在这边没有生活，但傍晚周围很多人开着小皮卡沿街在十字路口聚众卖水果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在成都和重庆犹豫时，王笛的《茶馆》是我最终选择来成都的重要原因。去了大慈寺的禅茶社，多是中老年人，人民公园的鹤鸣茶社平均年龄年轻一些，也更吵闹一些。以前似乎是堂倌加热水的，现在是自己提个开水壶。在鹤鸣里有采耳的，看相的，书里说这些人都要给茶馆钱。鹤鸣是阿姨年纪的服务员，民国女性进入茶馆做工曾被指责伤风败俗。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我爱冰粉，下馆子每顿都以冰粉作为结尾。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;爱情是固有的&#34;&gt;爱情是固有的&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一席 魏小石的讲座 里面讲到突厥 土耳其的民歌 多是以爱人为主题 爱情是固有的 不是启蒙运动后文学作品宣扬人们才幻想 爱情是固有的&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一人称的压抑的声音不适合表达今天的生活了。今天的情况与其说是我们都在压抑自己更加黑暗的冲动；不如说是你很难守住一个中心了，因为今天，情况总是，令人感到刺激地，你可以成为另一个人，你可以和另一个人结婚，你可以从事另一种职业，你可以过另一种生活——只要你加入健身房。我们生活在一个眼界总在刺激我们成为别人的世界。各种各样的榜样从四面八方向我们袭来。这几乎就像是一个反题式的问题了：要坚持任何自我感都是困难的，因为我们总被告知，你可以成为你想要成为的一切，只要你用心。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如今，已经有刻画人物的典型手法了。你会看到一位在当下处在痛苦中的艺术家，然后是一些关键的闪回，回忆在三岁时经验的事件，而这，解释了他们为什么有毒瘾。在通俗小说和通俗戏剧中，这已经变成一种懒惰的，建立角色的方式了。你把某人出来披露他们的创伤的时刻放进去，然后你就有一个完全成型的角色了。像我这样的所谓的文学作家也难逃其咎，尽管我们以稍微复杂、精致的方式为之。你会想建立一个角色和一个非常有趣的人，然后你不得不用过去的事情来解释它，然后你就“完成”那个角色了。而在真实生活中，人们更神秘得多。你可能认识一个人很多很多年，然后对于他身上的很多东西，你还是没法解释。你会有一个很好的孩子，然后，突然，“为什么你会变成这样！”或者别的什么。人比模型更复杂。人改变自己生活、或在生命的中途改变自己的潜能，（在小说中）被低估了。你可以根据某个小说家或某代小说家关于角色的假设、根据你如何写出完整的角色和你基本上是如何在弗洛伊德式的小说的基础上建设的，来确定那个作家或那代作家所处的时代。也许，是时候向前，是时候接受更多预料之外的、无法理解的人性的时候了，而这会在小说的形式、声音和结构的层面上带来明显的后果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;离开&#34;&gt;离开&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;幼年动荡生活，对一个人是一种摧毁，那会造成一种惯性，让人以为不用原地解决问题，或者说，离开原地就解决了问题。——韩松落&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;文字与对话&#34;&gt;文字与对话&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;不要用手帐 除非是为了做“艺术品” 资料电子化 不能检索和方便回顾的记录是无用的 这也是我当时想为什么鲁迅要那么写日记 行事历的意义在于你能快速回到那一天 知道自己做了什么 统一的记录格式对于长时间回顾是必要的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;没有目的性的记笔记没有任何用 说个小细节 淡豹今天那篇讲妻妾的文章里提到鲁迅的《小杂感》很突兀的（也有可能是我一个人） 但我晚上听完live我就知道为什么会出现这一段 她准备live提纲的时候看到了 写的时候就用了 我认为的好的写作者是 灵活地利用素材去充实文章&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“如何能够看到字后是有人的，人是有目标的，人和人是在对话和论争的，他们的对话和论争是有诉求的，也是有结果的。” 好的写作者是有意识在训练和有意识在发声的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;大多数对话和讨论中的参与者在使用词语是是模糊的，双方或许并未对同一个词语的所指达成“共识” 此时需要弄清词语具体指代的是什么&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;黄灿然的《诗歌的技艺与诗人的感受力》讲 好的诗歌是捕捉“不可言说之物“的 是用言语表达会崩塌的东西 这和之前和卫析聊的不同人对mystical moment感受力是同个问题&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;robert-fortune&#34;&gt;Robert Fortune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;为什么英国人爱喝加糖加奶的红茶：英国当时水源卫生条件不好 本来喝酒都比喝水安全 茶沸水煮 杀菌 2. 怀孕的妇女喝酒对小孩影响不好 喝茶能让更多劳动力健康成长 3. 从农民变成工人 和茶同食器的糖成为廉价的大众消费品 这也是为什么英国人喝茶习惯加糖加奶 是廉价的能量来源 4. fortune发现中国出口的绿茶用有害物质加工过（为了显得更绿）这个事情披露后英国人当时就只喝black tea了&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fortune这个人也挺有意思的 出身一般 把茶引入到印度后就有了些名气 后来再来日本和中国取了很多植物种子 改进了ward case 使得植物经过长途海上运输存活率大大提高 做过kew的园长 美国南北战争前专利局还高薪聘请他去英国找茶树带到美国 试图在南方种后来美国人觉得自己可以 就半路把他炒了 工资也没付 但南北战争后奴隶制废除美国没有廉价劳动力了 生长的成本是印度的五六倍 在国际市场上没有竞争力&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;十八十九世纪有很多英国人在各个殖民地把植物带回英国 香港植物园当时和kew有官方联系 这也是英国博物学or园艺学发展的社会背景之一&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;冬至&#34;&gt;冬至&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;生我时我爸才18岁 他属于小混混那种 花天酒地 吃喝玩乐 就算我出生也这样 我小时候和爷爷奶奶一起住 二年级时我奶奶去世了 四年级时我爷爷的弟弟去世了 初一时我爷爷去世了 当时有个算命先生说我十五岁时会经历一次大劫 那是我爷爷去世后一年 本来算命说这些没什么 但有前面的铺垫 很多人说我们家族每隔两年就会有人去世 当时就老担心我会死 有次学校打疫苗 说第二天打针那里就没痕迹了 老师问的时候 全班没有人举手 我也没举手 暗地里观察别人 还去隔壁班问“你们班有人伤口没退的嘛” 都没有 后来偷偷和老师说 老师让家长带去医院检查 检查出来没事&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我叔去外面打工 不知道在哪搞来一辆山地车 说搞来是因为有人说是偷的 但我也不管这些 小孩子只要有车骑 当时整个镇子上只有我这一辆山地车 特别威风 有时候耍帅 脱把骑 有次前面有块大石头 来不及反应 整个车子就飞起来了 车把尖的往喉咙上撞 当时脑子里的念头 就是撞上就要死了 往回撤了撤 从喉结那擦过去 回想算命先生说的是不是这事 还有个算命先生说我会读中国政法大学 填志愿时我爸想起来 让我报中国政法大学 我就是不报 现在我工作不稳定 我爸还老拿这事说我&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我奶奶去世 下葬那天 我在学校上学 偷了一只粉笔 可能是想在哪瞎画什么 回来的路上看到很多人在挖坑 埋我奶奶 我也没走近 离了有一二十米 我也在地上挖坑 别人埋我奶奶 我把兜里唯一一只粉笔埋了 埋的时候我心里想“我要好好学习”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;悼念denovo&#34;&gt;悼念denovo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二零一四年读白先勇的《纽约客》，读完其中一篇，最强烈的想法是“他一定有很重要的人去世了”，去查，知道他和王国祥。
朋友读詹宏志的《旅行与读书》说“然而说不清为什么，虽然作者是温和平缓的语气在讲述，经历也都没有太多的戏剧性，却在愉快幽默中，流露出一丝落寞甚至忧伤。”詹宏志的妻子王宣一于2015年意外去世。
有些人的离去，会成为你生命的背景音，这在我来看，是最高尚的爱（之一）。
子文东说“有些人离开了仍将永生，迟到的人会循着文字与影像的痕迹，去往昔与你们重逢。”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>村上春树写不写日记？</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/harukimurakami/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2017 15:30:50 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/harukimurakami/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/p444862912.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一次读村上应该是10年读的《海边的卡夫卡》，11年读了《挪威的森林》，这边印象很深刻，特别是渡边度过的孤独的周末，还读了《寻羊冒险记》，当时当奇幻小说看的。13年读了《当我谈跑步时我谈些什么》这本是第一本村上的随笔集，喜欢跑步，所以也很喜欢。16年读了《1q84》，喜欢青豆那条线，但最后的结局不是很满意，15年读了《没有色彩的多崎作和他的巡礼之年》当时没有想到第二年会被胡绝交，朋友的否定导致自我的怀疑。村上的小说有一种氛围很吸引我，可剧情每到后半部，总有一种强硬的感觉，但为了那种氛围，也读了不少本。但直到《我的职业是小说家》，才了解到：村上并不长居在日本，居住和创作都经常在海外，《挪威的森林》是在欧洲写的，《海边的卡夫卡》是在夏威夷写的；除了写小说，他还写随笔，写游记（一本也未读过），做翻译（从来不知道）；在世界各地都很受欢迎，作品被翻译成五十多种语言（还是在五十多个国家发行？），豆瓣Haruki Murakami的作品条目足足有489条；村上主动推动了自己作品在美国乃至世界的发行，他对“日本作家”的自我认同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书中，村上谈了关于原创性的看法，三个基本条件：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一、拥有与其他表现者迥然相异、独具特色的风格（或是曲调，或是文体，或是手法，或是色彩），必须让人看上一眼（艇上一下），就能立刻明白是他的作品&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二、必须凭借一己之力怼自身风格更新换代。风格要与时俱进，不断成长，不能永远停留在原地。要拥有这种自发的、内在的自我革新力。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;三、其独具特色的风格必须随着时间流逝化为标准，必须吸纳到人们的精神中，成为价值判断基准的一部分，或者成为后来者丰富的引用源泉。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然讲的最多的是如何创作“我投入漫长的岁月，构筑起属于自己的固有体系，让这种写作方式成为可能，并以自己的方式谨小慎微地进行整备，郑重其事地维持至今。为它拭去污垢、注入机油，努力不让它生出一点锈斑。身为一个作家，这件事尽管微不足道，却让我有一种类似自豪的心情。对我来说、与其谈论一部部作品的成绩与评价，不如来谈谈这种整体的体系，这样更令人愉快，并且也值得具体谈论。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前读过一本小书《Daily Rituals: How Artists Work》，内容是161个创作者的日常工作习惯。里面关于村上的一章写到：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When he is writing a novel, Murakami wakes at 4:00 A.M. and works for five to six hours straight. In the afternoons he runs or swims (or does both), run errands, reads, and listens to music; bedtime is 9:00. ‘I keep to this routine every day without variation,’ he told The Paris Review in 2004. ’The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon resolved to change his habits completely, moving with his wife to a rural area, quitting smoking, drinking less, and eating a diet of mostly vegetables and fish. He also started running daily, a habit he has kept up for more than a quarter century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;阅读时，我想到了《奇特的一生》写的柳比歇夫，他从一九一六年到一九七二年他去世的那一天，一丝不苟地用时间统计法记下他的时间支出。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这种时间统计法的记录是这样的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“乌里扬诺夫斯克。1964年4月7日。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;分类昆虫学(画两张无名袋蛾的图)——3 时15分。 鉴定袋蛾——20分(1.0)。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;附加工作:给斯拉瓦写信——2 时45分(0.5)。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;社会工作:植物保护小组开会——2 时25分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;休息:给伊戈尔写信——10分;《乌 扬诺夫斯克真 报》——10分; 列夫·托尔斯泰的《塞瓦斯托 波尔故事》——1 时25分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;基本工作合计——6 时20分。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最近读的《鲁迅日记》是这样的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;十日晴。上午往大陆大学讲演〔2〕。午真吾来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十一日星期。昙。下午玉堂来。梓生来。晚内山完造招饮于川久料理店，同席长谷川如是闲、郁达夫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十二日雨。晚得陈翔冰信。得小峰信并期刊三种。夜林和清来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;十三日昙。无事。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有人会疑惑，为什么鲁迅和柳比歇夫的日记要这么写，我认为相比于日记，更应该称作日志。柳比歇夫，鲁迅（包括村上）都明白自己要进行的是长期的工作，观察比较长期工作状态，就需要固定的标准。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;柳比歇夫记录了自己做各项工作的时间（写作、研究、例行工作、非科研型的活动、娱乐、阅读、交通、交际）。鲁迅日记的内容主要是书（买书，别人送书，送别人书）、 人际交往（别人来拜访，自己拜访别人，通信，赠礼）、社会活动（会议、聚餐）、金钱（工资，兼职收入，借款）、天气、清洁（理发，濯足）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“柳比歇夫通过他的时间统计法对自己进行了研究和试验：试验在写、读、听、工作、思索各方面，他到底能干多少？干多少？怎么干？他不让自己负担过重，力不胜任；他总是循着他能力的边缘前进，他对自己能力的掂量愈来愈精确。这是一条永不停顿的自我认识的道路。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;回到村上春树，他很清楚自己为什么选择这样的“生活方式”，是为了保持最佳的状态来进行小说创作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“然后说到写小说这项工作，我却能一天连续五个小时坐在书桌前，始终保持一颗强韧的心。这种心灵的强韧并非与生俱来，而是后天获得的东西。我通过有意识地训练自己，才掌握了它。进一步说，只要有心去做，即便不说是“轻而易举”，至少谁都能通过努力在一定程度上掌握。当然，说到这种强人，它就像身体的强韧一样，不是要同他人较量竞争，而是为了让此时此刻的自己保持最佳状态。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好奇村上春树写不写日记？&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>顺化的坟墓</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hue_tomb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2017 15:19:52 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hue_tomb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;读福琼《两访中国茶乡》，描述他十九世纪中叶在舟山岛上看到几座坟墓”在埋葬死者的坟堆前面，铺了一条很美的路，还有精美的石雕，与南方圆形坟墓不同，这几个坟墓都是用砖石砌成方形。墓地四周通常都像英国一样——我想全世界大概都是如此，种上一些苍松翠柏之类的。乔瑟林爵士在他的《中国行军记》一书中，对此作了如下一番生动、恰当的描写：‘山坡上就像随意栽种的一样，到处都是一丛丛的松鼠，透过密密的松叶，可以看到民房和寺庙的屋顶，林间景象也随之变得丰富起来。在这些众多的小树林中，不仅是行人为其优美的景致吸引而停下脚步，死者也挑中这儿作为他们的长眠之地，坟墓上长着一些甜甜的铁线莲和芬芳的花朵，看着眼前这静谧的景象，面对如此美丽的坟墓，哪怕是最粗心的人恐怕也不能无动于衷吧。’“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;想起两个月前越南途中的一些小事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去顺化是临时订下的，出发时计划在河内每日吃粉，泡咖啡馆，待足两周就回家。一日，青旅free dinner，邻座的法国女生，金色卷发随意绑在脑后，说起在越南最快乐的日子是在顺化由尼姑开办的的 duc son orphanage（中译应是春山）度过。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺化三年前来越南时去过，从北到南巴士旅途的中转站，从河内到会安要在顺化停留几小时，匆匆逛了逛顺化皇城——对中国人来说，只能说是打了好多折的故宫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在手机上浏览了孤儿院的网站，就让前台帮忙定了第二日的车票。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;春山寺位于市中心十几公里外，开着谷歌地图骑着旅店租来的单车前往。渐渐从水泥路变成了了无人烟的泥路，顺化算山区，上上下下，沿路郁郁葱葱的树木中夹着几栋明显中式装饰风格的民居。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;突然眼前出现了一片开阔的空地，远处时低矮的山坡，近处首先注意到的是安静吃草的黄牛，比我想象的牛来的瘦。还零落着一些建筑物，砖石制成，外面围了一圈矮墙，中间前方是小一号的牌坊和塔楼，后面是高起的半圆形的屏障，慢慢意识到是坟墓。我下车走近站了一会，牛在吃草，看也没看我一眼。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>做家务</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;读杜森的(&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;老妈子配厨子&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/note/630635511/&#34;&gt;https://www.douban.com/note/630635511/&lt;/a&gt;)，想起一些事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我妈是家庭主妇，从小到大除了偶尔会出去参加饭局，很少在外吃饭，都是妈妈掌厨，但当时也是做点家务的。初中住校，我妈对我的要求是每周打扫一次，范围包括我的卧室，我的洗手间，还有书房（都是我在用），卧室的阳台，先用扫帚扫一遍，再用拖把拖一遍，最后用毛巾抹（ma）一遍，衣服扔洗衣机（住校时衣服一周拿回家洗一次），贴身衣物一定得手洗，饭后洗碗。似乎有奖赏，洗碗五毛钱，后来涨到一块，打扫卫生五块钱。
这样看来，我从小做的家务不算少，但并没有因此体谅家人的辛苦。我当时一周的伙食费是一百元，平时出去玩可以另要零花钱，做家务是迫于母亲的“淫威”。
还在杭州住时，有次朋友母亲过来暂住，做了几次饭，我开始庆幸我妈的厨艺还不错，父亲偶尔会叫一帮朋友来家里吃饭，母亲掌勺，大菜小菜做七八个，众人都快吃完了，母亲才刚忙完开始吃。我忘了吃完饭之后我是在做什么，可能是在叔叔阿姨面前扮乖巧，或者可能是上楼把自己关在房间里，从没注意过最后是谁打扫的残局。
近几年回家，开头几天，母亲会把我喜欢的菜挨个做一遍，和小时候不一样的是，现在她坚决不让我洗碗，我也由着她，等热情过了就轮得到我洗了，就是她去买菜，我都跟着。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我一直不会做饭，记得有次一边煮面，一边在楼上书房玩游戏，等想起来下楼时锅整个都烧焦了，怕被责骂努力清理了现场，结果忘记墙上烟熏的痕迹，一眼就被戳穿。（我这个人，似乎没有做坏事的天赋。）
还有一次，父母都出门，试图煮面，拿铝锅烧开水，下面条，找了些豆腐皮扔进去，调料之类一概没加，勉强吃了几口，倒了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;后来，上了大学，搬出来住，开始琢磨着做饭，第一次开火，打蛋都够呛，一开始还会学着下厨房里的菜式，后来嫌费时间费功夫，吃得最多的是“煮一锅”。合租的朋友也不太会做家务，几个人都懒，厨房卫生间是用完自己解决，客厅是等乱了看不下去了的那个人打扫。不怎么会做饭，饮食习惯也相异，他们分别点外卖，我继续“煮一锅”，倒是每周去附近的菜场或是超市买个菜。
家里陆续购置了吸尘器，厨余粉碎机，直饮水机，现代科技是人类进步的阶梯！
我对做饭、洗碗都不怎么排斥，最讨厌洗衣服，最终买了消毒液，所有东西一起扔进洗衣机，解放双手。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前几日有天晚上，带弟弟去打羽毛球，打完回来他说肚子饿，怂恿我点外卖，我自己很少吃夜宵，但还是去厨房给他煮面，方便面，加了蛋和火腿，还去门口剪了些番薯叶。吃完，想了想，又自己把碗洗了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有次领了个快递，朋友问我买了什么，我说床单。他问：你不是有床单吗？我说：要换啊。后来跟他妈妈提起这事，阿姨说：他最喜欢那套蓝色的床单，天气好的话，洗完一天就干了，我下午就能给他重新换上。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人活着，吃饭清洁和维持舒适的居住环境，不是特别费事，但还是得花点时间和精力。如果一个人不操心这些事，那一定是有人为你操心了这些。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;二十億光年的孤獨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谷川俊太郎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地球人在小小的地球上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;睡覺 蘇醒 和 工作&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有時想和火星人做朋友&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;火星人在小小的火星上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;做著什麼 我不清楚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;或許在睡覺 打扮 和 苦惱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但我確信他們&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有時想和地球人做朋友&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;萬有引力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是互相吸引的孤獨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宇宙正在拉扯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家於是渴望相識&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宇宙飛快膨脹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家為此感到憂愁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;對著二十億光年的孤獨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我忍不住打了個噴嚏&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>当我们讨论意义时</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/whatsaboutmeaning/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:47:07 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/whatsaboutmeaning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;今天和朋友A和B在广州玩，先去了方所，我翻了几本摄影集，A买了一本弗朗索瓦·莫里亚克的《爱的荒漠》和弗里德·里奇的《摄影之后》。A和B都不拍照，A买书的想法可能是好奇吧，于是他们展开了一段“现在大多数拍照的人基本功都很不扎实，感光度、快门速度、焦距都搞不清楚”的谈话。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对我来说，摄影水平高下的唯一判断标准是看作品，虽然心里白眼已经翻满，但没有争论的意愿，也没说话，就在ig上发了之前那条post。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之后去sigma cafe，入座后A拿了我的相机看了看，于是讨论了会相机（一些事实，比如说35的焦段大多拍人文，不是只有sony才有微单产品，富士、奥林巴斯都有。）A有sony a6000，他说：“我对摄影没兴趣，当时买相机是想做视频，因为摄影只能展现现实的东西，摄像你还可以创造些‘假’的东西。”我不同意他说的“摄影只能展现现实的东西”，认为摄影也能表现超现实和更抽象的东西，翻出很喜欢的摄影师Bernard Faucon的作品。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/U6986P704DT20160926113548.png&#34; alt=&#34;faucon&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/U6986P704DT20160926113546.png&#34; alt=&#34;faucon&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A随便看了几眼，评价说“这很一般啊 一看就都是政治隐喻 比如这火” 当时我就炸了 WTF “这关政治隐喻什么事？” “你凭什么如此专断地说一个作品的意义是什么？”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A的观点是“一个作品创造出来之后，是独立于创作者的存在。它的意义不是由创作意图决定的，我从政治隐喻这个社会角度去评价没有任何问题。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的观点是“暂且同意作品是独立于创作者的存在，我们对作品的解读也要尊重创作意图，再者，并不是所有的评价都是合理的，有些评价make sense，有些评价不make sense，如果评价一幅苏联时期的海报‘火是政治隐喻’在这种context下可以接受，但放在弗孔作品这个context下，这句推论是坨屎。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A的观点有个前提条件是，他是个对事物的评价完全不在于别人看法的人（这也是个很牛逼的三观啊。。。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的观点有个前提条件是，我认为我对弗孔作品的解读是更为正确的，把我对弗孔作品解读作为一个benchmark来评价A对弗孔作品的评价。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B对我们的争论的看法是：所有对客观存在的评价都是一对客观存在（reality）和观点（viewpoint）的couple，客观存在(r)只有一个，但观点会有我的观点（Vi），个体A的观点（Va），某些个体组成的某个群体的观点（Vgroup），主流的观点（Vmainstream）甚至理论上存在一个全集的观点（Vall），他并不怎么在乎单一个体的观点，在乎的是这个观点之上的higher rank的东西。以摄影作品为例，作品是个客观存在，有一群摄影师对这个作品有一个评价，那群摄影师对这个作品有另一个评价，主流有一个评价，他不在乎单一的观点，在乎这些群体的观点背后更高层次的结构。（比如说不同摄影师群体的特质，摄影师群体和圈外人评价的话语权力。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我说B属于理论家，（他真的一点都不拍照，但他依然可以用纯理论地东西发表对摄影甚至艺术的观点。搞数学的是不是都这思维模式？）我属于实践派（自我要求是不实践某个领域就少评价），也算拍了不少照片看了不少影集但几乎不读摄影理论。（把A忘了吧&amp;hellip;）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后反思的问题是，并不能说“一个人不拍照就不能评价摄影作品”，就像不能说一个人不拍电影就不能写影评。不同于工程问题（一个信号发射器的目标对象是手机，手机接收的好是客观的标准）摄影甚至往大点说艺术，它的consumers不局限于摄影师，必然也需要接受外行人的评价，外界的评价能扩宽摄影对世界的外延，把是否实践作为能否评价的门槛更像维护自己的话语霸权。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这让我想到前段时间在香港认识一群跑马拉松的，于是在朋友圈经常会看到某某在某地（国内或者异国）跑马拉松，之后的社交活动，还有排酸等等群体行为。我跑步，但没跑过马拉松，近些年看到关于马拉松的报道是一些列“为什么说长跑是中产阶级的新宗教？”“跑步已成为中国中产阶级的新信仰”“中产阶级为何兴起马拉松热?”“跑完马拉松,完成你对中产阶级的幻想”大致的观点是“马拉松成为新的展现中产阶级地位、重视健康、有钱有闲的方式”。我甚至出于好奇给不是很熟的跑马拉松的朋友转发过类似的文章，想问问圈内人的看法。（对方最后算打个哈哈略过了这个问题，我这个行为不怎么符合社交礼仪啊hhh有些冒犯人家了）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;试图以跑马拉松的人角度来看，我跑马拉松就是跑个步啊，之后排酸啊大吃大喝都很正常啊，发个朋友圈就发个朋友圈啊。有个不跑马拉松的人写了篇文章说“在斯洛文尼亚哲学家齐泽克的身体政治意义上，中产阶级们身体被完全剥离体力劳动、从事着非物质生产，也往往沉浸于身体与自由分离的统治幻觉中，而当他们重新掌握自己的身体而重新安排了个人生活空间和进程，相对僵化固定的日常生活和社会秩序而言，无异于重新获得了个人主权，他或她都要开始认真面对时间剥削的资本主义或者任何权力体系所制造的身体政治幻觉。”，他是不是个傻逼啊？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你既知道跑马拉松的人觉得写文章的人是个傻逼，也知道写文章的人觉得跑马拉松的人是中产阶级的一种生活方式，这种知道就很重要，这是B的观点。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后摘抄一段我最喜欢的关于摄影的谈论，来自维姆·文德斯的《一次》：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;拍照。摄影是时间的行为，是要从时间里摄取些什么，是另一种形式的永恒。人们总是猜测，那从时间里夺得的瞬间，就在摄影机前面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事实并非如此，摄影乃是一种双向的行为：向前和往后。是的，也可以“往后进行”。这个比喻并非那么谬以千里 ，这就如同猎手端起武器，瞄准面前的猎物射击。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一旦子弹飞出枪膛，就会产生后坐力。摄影师按下快门的瞬间，同样有后坐力，推动自己。一幅照片永远有双重画面：拍摄对象以及多多少少可见的“后面”，也就是“后坐力”：拍照瞬间的摄影师自己。
这种反照存在于每一幅照片里，任何镜头都无法捕捉。如同猎手无法被自己的子弹击中，而只能感知武器的后坐力。什么是摄影师的“后坐力”？如何感知？又如何体现在照片里？ 对照片有着怎样的影响力？德语里有一个特别贴切的词，可以形容这个事实。一个词，适用于不同的领域：EINSTELLUNG（调整）。用来表示一种行为，人会调整自己，从心理上或者从道德上，也就是准备做什么，然后开始“行动”。“调整”也是一个摄影的或者电影的概念，意指画面和取景， 以及如何“调整”摄影机的光圈和速度，然后摄影师开始“行动”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一切绝非偶然，同样一个词既指一个行为，也指在这一行为中所产生的图片。每一个“调整”（也是每一幅图片）实际上折射出了拍摄者本身的“调整”（行为）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;猎人所感知的后坐力，如同照片背后隐隐约约的摄影师的面孔。并非是要捕捉他的面容，而是他的行为，是他面对眼前事物时的自我调整。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影机是眼睛，能从前面看，同时也能向后看。向前拍摄一幅照片，向后留下的则是摄影师灵魂的侧影： 摄影机向后看，透过摄影师的眼睛看到他的动机。是的，摄影机向前看到了拍摄对象，
向后看到了拍摄的动机，就是为什么要捕捉这个拍摄对象。它同时表现了事物以及对事物的愿望。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: 之后开玩笑说，我炸毛可能是因为sigma都是白墙，灯光又太亮了，让人神经紧张，容易焦虑XD&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>使用python下载instagram图片（中国大陆）</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/download_from_instagram/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 20:47:56 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/download_from_instagram/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;0&#34;&gt;0.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本科毕业论文做的是默克尔和奥巴马instagram形象对比分析，当年半点程序背景都没有（拿chrome查看源代码找图片链接到是会的）但instagram似乎挺不支持这个行为，源代码里都找不到图片地址。所以，当初我手动截图（加排序）了两个人官方账号里的所有图片。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，稍微学习了一点编程就想把这件事实现了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-instaraider--instalooter&#34;&gt;1. instaRaider &amp;amp; instaLooter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谷歌搜索了下，发现已经有人造好了轮子&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/akurtovic/InstaRaider&#34;&gt;instaRaider&lt;/a&gt;，而且把怎么造轮子的过程都写清楚了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirkurtovic.com/blog/how-to-download-photos-from-instagram-a-hack/&#34;&gt;How to download photos from Instagram – A Hack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个项目吸引我的地方是它不需要instagram的api，所以也不需要授权(authentication)。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但这个项目已经停止维护了，instaRaider的作者在readme里推荐了另一个项目&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter&#34;&gt;instaLooter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我看到instaLooter的readme里使用方式只有两行代码时我的内心好喜悦啊
​
$ instaLooter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; [options]
$ instaLooter hashtag &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; [options]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后就报错了&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=&#39;www.instagram.com&#39;, port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /jarrywan9/ (Caused by NewConnectionError(&#39;&amp;lt;requests.packages.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x10402a4d0&amp;gt;: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 65] No route to host&#39;,))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;原因是我instagram在国内被封了&amp;hellip;而我翻墙走的是shadowsocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-利用proxychains解决shadowsocks非全局代理问题&#34;&gt;2. 利用proxychains解决shadowsocks非全局代理问题&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;下面开始感恩前室友小讲堂：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;代理通常分两步：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;把线路搞起来 e.g. shadowsocks或vpn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;让程序流量走这个线路&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;代理可分为全局代理和非全局代理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;全局代理是全部程序的流量都走代理，譬如通常的vpn。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而shadowsocks是非全局的，默认是连上之后本地开一个服务端口 譬如1080，然后通常把浏览器流量设置到走这个端口。ss本质是一个socks5服务，需要监听一个本地端口，这个就是ss服务跑起来以后在你机器上面的服务端口(其他程序譬如浏览器会把流量发到这个端口，由ss发到境外服务器）（我目前用的shadowsocks软件是shadowsocksx2，端口是写死了的1080）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;解决方案有两个：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;用一个全局的翻墙方案 譬如vpn 这样这个python脚本的流量默认翻墙了&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;仍然是shadowsocks 不过设置程序流量走ss这个服务端口&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// 考虑第二个方案的实现成本比让前室友重新设置个vpn给我低一些 所以选择了方案二）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;此时，要用到另外一个轮子 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/haad/proxychains&#34;&gt;proxychains&lt;/a&gt;,
设置方法参照了&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tuicool.com/articles/rUNFF3&#34;&gt;利用proxychains在终端使用socks5代理&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# proxychains安装
git clone https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng.git
cd proxychains-ng
./configure
make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install
cp ./src/proxychains.conf /etc/proxychians.conf
cd .. &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -rf proxychains-ng

# 编辑proxychains配置
# 需要学习下vim的操作，配置文件修改需要管理员权限 mac环境下前面加sudo
vim /etc/proxychains.conf

# 将socks4 127.0.0.1 9095改为
socks5  127.0.0.1 1080  //1080改为你自己的端口

# 在需要代理的命令前加上 proxychains4，如：
proxychains4 instaLooter jarrywan9 ./Downloads/jarrywan9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;其他需要注意的一些事情：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;每个轮子都有Requirements，要确认下是否都安装了&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proxychains用$ brew install proxychains 也可以安装，我是brew刚好需要更新，但死也更新不了&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-总结&#34;&gt;4. 总结&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;学习编程时要尝试解决实际问题&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有轮子的时候就用轮子，避免重复劳动（虽然现在我也写不出&amp;hellip;）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;开源项目的readme要认真写，&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter&#34;&gt;instaLooter&lt;/a&gt;的小哥readme和代码写的都很干净&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;去年总结时发现一整年没认识一个人 全是老朋友 于是定了个小目标 “年轻人要开放点” 一年过去了 参加了128次社交活动 见了88个人（比去年多了43个） 有41个是第一次见面的 其中有21个值得一见 还有9个人想有机会加深下友谊 #再也不说自己是社恐了# #图是python画的#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;六月被hyq绝交真的是出乎我的意料 但后来往回想又有些意料之中 和cpy算是终于经过了漫长的磨合期 获得了考验（？） 十年好友是特别安心的存在 若曦我永远觉得她好可爱 有些朋友心思敏感一些 要多体谅她们&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;认识了一些新朋友 但心里明白有些阶段已经过去了 觉得谁很有趣很欣赏 也很互相合得来 但交个挚友需要太多相处的时间了 现在大家能一年见个一两面已经很不容易&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家都还没有长大到可以做彼此的依靠的地步 自己要好好加油啊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2017&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2017:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今年读的交易方面的书不太多 主要是实践了半年 感受到了交易心理的重要性 下半年主要是在反省和努力合理规避交易心理对交易系统的影响 也认识了一些交易上的朋友（仍然不能算太多）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;写十篇书评（每月一篇）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年最主要的进步是读了好多篇外文文献和好几本外文著作，跟着公开课的readings读，《社会学古典理论》读了很多经典的原文（翻译成英文的），《穆斯林世界的基本冲突》读了很多欧洲那边的法律学和民族国家相关的论文。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;九月和方媛的谈话、《ethnicity and nationalism》还有近几年越来越强烈的反穆斯林公众舆论激起了我对这个问题的兴趣。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最早我是关注国内的城乡差距、劳工问题的，现在这方面的兴趣点也有，但兴趣点逐渐转向城市研究（全球大城市之间的联络）、现代化、全球化视野下的劳动力流动（低端劳动力也好（家政劳工），高端劳动力（程序员：技术工人）也好，所以对广州的中东移民很有兴趣）、消费社会（买买买和极简主义）、货币机制（美元、人民币）。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近一年对digital nomads（感觉有点像当代嬉皮）在全球边缘地区的生活（清迈、巴厘岛等等）挺好奇的，所以想明年有机会去清迈住两三个月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;印象派简史&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影部分见[3.摄影]，对于艺术目前是这么看的，创造是一种欲望，创造既要表现本真，又要和别人不太一样。我个人对现代艺术是完全不感冒，但能理解他们，因为前人很多事情都做过了。
对人像的兴趣是由肖像绘画而起。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的看法是如果目前有创新精神的人会去拍电影，做电子乐（算是体现时代精神吧）；往前推一百年，这些人可能会去拍照；往前推两三百年，这些人可能会去画画，写小说。技术进步对艺术形式的影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-摄影&#34;&gt;3. 摄影&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年摄影依然集中在街头人文纪实这块，三月帮xsn拍了次私房，其实自己非常满意（相信自己还是有点天赋） 但找妹子太累了 老对着一个妹子拍也太累了 （不过周围的朋友可以试着约约看）五月拍了组建筑和极简风格的（鼓楼堂 良渚文化村 紫金港）所以今年还是尝试了不少新东西 但没有太深入 这可能是限于人的精力始终是有限的 但能欣赏的领域越来越宽（是件好事）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;主要的拍摄项目是上海弄堂、广州老街、台湾街巷、香港和汕头（集中在南方），都不能说是项目，创作的主动性或者说选择性还是比较弱，大多数拍照还是在街上瞎逛。进步主要是在色彩的控制上，对工具的微调掌握的更好了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;照片的同质化是一个问题，李想给我留言“有些立意是不錯，顏色什麼的其實都還好，但是看久了就覺得⋯⋯怎麼所有照片都差不多”
我的回复说“很正常，因為同一個題材同一個拍攝者 除非做巨大的改變 不然就是差不多的 很多攝影師都存在這個問題 到了一定階段 很難突破 想要不一樣 可以換題材 也可以換地方 但我覺得攝影技術的進步既可以表現在對不同題材的處理 也可以表現在對顏色 構圖 比例的掌握上⋯⋯ 我是挺明確感受到了近一年來在色彩上的長進 再者是照片畢竟就一張圖 更複雜的東西光靠照片是表達不出來的”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但同样是街拍 也是有高下之分的 我能分辨也能承认即使是同题材同类型 别人比我拍的好 看好的作品依然会给我带来很深的触动 别人为什么可以拍的这么好 怎么想 怎么拍 怎么付出的努力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“他熱愛那種必須經由嚴格訓練方能獲得的自由、恰到好處的孤獨感，以及一種看世界的全新視角。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently living and studying in Dublin, Ireland, working as software engineer. This is my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jarrywangcn&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;photography-amateur&#34;&gt;Photography Amateur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not a qualified photographer, but I&amp;rsquo;m keen on taking photos. Although I usually take street snapshots, I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in Portrait, Food and Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite photographers are Martin Parr, Vivian Maier, Jeff Wall, Marc Riboud, Ueda Shoji, Lv Nan, and Bernard Faucon. This is my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywang.format.com&#34;&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; page. Recently I post my photos on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/jarrywan9/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
