&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First year cyling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cycling is definitely the most important hobby for me this year. From strava, it shows i cycled 2500km. If taking commute into consideration, would be around 3000km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Clontarf Cycling Club. ngl, the club is super Irish and middle-aged people over 40, 50, 60 and i&amp;rsquo;m a outlier. However, learned a lot from them and every time group spin, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge and fun to push myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cycling not only gives me the way to exercise, but also brings me to lots of places around Dublin i&amp;rsquo;ve never been. Before I never go out of Dublin city center. But this year, i&amp;rsquo;ve been to Bray, Dalkey, Wicklow, Enniskerry, Killakee, Glencullen in the south, Portmarnock, Malahide, Swords, Skerries in the north, Lucan in the south. (Sorry, this is all the village names around Dublin suburbs.) And the group always guided me to lovely cute local coffee shop. This is the most authentic Irish experience for me as an immigrants 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First 100km in Feb &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/fd8aea2cb5464ccfac830.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;100km&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wicklow spin in May, Sally gap - Wicklow gap, i look so young with the group XD &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/b447f75857c79a5e3b73a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wicklow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike Touring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing cycling brings me is bike touring. As traveling after so many years, i know my preference is to go to local places (don&amp;rsquo;t need to be famous) and see how local people&amp;rsquo;s daily lifes and behaviors. However, because i can&amp;rsquo;t drive, i&amp;rsquo;m limited to the places I could reach by public transportation. This year, because of bike touring, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lots of interesting but niche places, as well as enjoying cycling at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots of memorable spins and a bit risky &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo; because of bike touring, such as cycle on southern freeway (Autopista Sur), carrying bike while hiking in Tenerife&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most memorable one is in Naples, I rented a bike for 3 days there. Here&amp;rsquo;s the travel notes taken back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I only stayed in the central area of Naples and had a biased impression of this multi-layered city. The closely-built, narrow alleys reminded me of the urban villages in Guangzhou. But if you go to the west coast and climb up the hill, the vibe of the neighborhood is similar to Mid-Levels in Hong Kong. It&amp;rsquo;s also similar to Lisbon and Istanbul in some ways. As it turns out, there must be some common patterns to developing cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycled to Pompeii, around Mount Vesuvius, and experienced the stone road, which made my hands and butt vibrate all the way and met traffic jam in literally every single town!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in napoli are very confident drivers, both cars and motors. They turn without signal lights, pass aside you within 0.5m. In the crossings, most of time no traffic lights, people need to negotiate with hands, facial expressions, beeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People parked anywhere, anytime. Parked 2 Columns on the same side of roads. Parked in the crossings. Parked suddenly to speak to passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t see any accident, I would say it’s a super good self-organized society 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a ferry with my bike to Ischia and had a thermal spring bath at Baia di Sorgeto, where had to manually mix the cold sea water with hot spring water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Bike Touring in Malaga, firt time with Clip Shoes and Fall, February &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/3fcb4bc8092b91c7fae01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malaga&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Climb this year in Tenerife, March! &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/453d998c77ad67d83449f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Teide&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naples in April, on the west coast looking to Vesuvius &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a36cc155ffce675286d01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Naples&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusseldorf along Rhine River in June, cycle with Diane &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/07ee84835ea222ef12da0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dusseldorf&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erhai Greenway, Dali in October &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9957c90caba38e2da1699.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dali&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get promotion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t talk much about work because i&amp;rsquo;m not ambitious on career. But still, this year i&amp;rsquo;ve made so much progress as a software engineer. Looking back, i almost didn&amp;rsquo;t do any solid work in the first one year and half. For example, i haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits in my team&amp;rsquo;s core packages, either C or Rust. But since April, I picked a very technical challenging project in Rust. So I had a steep learning curve on Rust, then our core package&amp;hellip; Then I picked another bigger both technical and design difficult project both in Go and Rust, also need to lead 2 new graduate teammates&amp;hellip; In the end, I finished them all, from knowing nothing to deliver results as well as own a big project. Then I got promoted&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often find myself starting things just as I cross the bottem passing grade, which makes the process somewhat painful, but leads to significant progress. Last year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even complete a two-day hiking trail, when i start to hike in Dolomites over 170+ kilometers…  This year, after just 2 months of owning a road bike, I joined a cycling club with the shortest group spin is over 70km. When I first got into DJing last year, I immediately started making friends in the DJ community. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt uncomfortable that I might be less skilled compared to someone else; instead, I&amp;rsquo;m always amazed by their talents and skills. I openly share what I&amp;rsquo;m into with almost everyone, which leads to more chances of serendipitously meeting like-minded people and engaging with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 3 years, I&amp;rsquo;m back in China. Actually i don&amp;rsquo;t feel strange. I still have lots of friends who could hangout together and have surprisling(&amp;hellip;) strong connection and mutal understanding. My fav pub in town still open, fav restaurant still open. Stay probably 3 weeks at home, had some family time with mom, Tiantian and Kangkang. And stay over with so many friend&amp;rsquo;s house. Thx for hosting me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/27a197f7b9a15c890c19a.png&#34; alt=&#34;china_2023&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel and stay with friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a reserved attitute about traveling with friends, the reasons are complicated and mixed. Partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable to stay with people together, partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t believe I could still keep having fun with one person. Partly because i like having adventure alone. Traveling solo will give me a adventurous feeling. But with my comfort zone with people progressing, I&amp;rsquo;ve arranged several trips with friends this year (sometimes one person, sometimes two.) Most of time, it goes well. Even something annoyed happened, I will communicate about it in the end. I do detect i don&amp;rsquo;t have fight or run situation for long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get stamp 4 (a work permit in Ireland, which don&amp;rsquo;t need company&amp;rsquo;s sponsorship)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t make lots of new friends this year, still meet  new people, sometimes during traveling, sometimes in Dublin, but not close and don&amp;rsquo;t have time to hangout. maybe i&amp;rsquo;m already very comfortable with current friend circle but anyways, why all the friends should be close friends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling: 78 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Portugal - Faro (2 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February &amp;amp; March: Spain - Malaga, Granada, Tenerife (10 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March &amp;amp; April: Italy - Rome, Neplas (11 days) w/ John, Frances, Wayne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Germany - Koln, Dusseldorf (3 days) w/ Diane; Spain - Barcelona (5 days) w/ Matthew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Swizterland &amp;amp; France - Geneva, Chamonix, Zermatt, Zurich (15 days) w/ Wayne, John, Frances, West, Alex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September &amp;amp; October: Hong Kong (2 days); China - Chaozhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, Linhai (12 days); Korean - Jeju (5 days) w/ Josh, Ying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: China - Dali (5 days) w/ Donglai &amp;amp; Iris; Hong Kong (1 day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus regions for me this year is South Europe, especailly Spain and Italy. Quote my instagram post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 3-4 months, I visited the following cities in South Europe around the Mediterranean Sea: Portugal&amp;rsquo;s Lisbon and Faro, Spain&amp;rsquo;s Malaga, Granada and Barcelona, and Italy&amp;rsquo;s Rome, Naples. If looking back a bit further, also visited Turkey&amp;rsquo;s Istanbul, Izmir, Fethiye and Antalya. Could say had a rough impression of the north Mediterranean area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in a region with a long, stable cultural history (Zhejiang is one of China&amp;rsquo;s core cultural regions since the Song Dynasty), I feel fascinated and amazed by how many culturally diverse influences have shaped the Mediterranean, including Carthage, Rome, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Arabic, and Moors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the cities I&amp;rsquo;ve visited have historical sites left by the Romans, Arabs, Carthaginians and Ottoman Turks. Over a long period, these empires&#39; borders have experienced expansion and contraction. What were once mosques have become churches in Granada, and what were once churches have become mosques in Istanbul. The alternation of civilizations happens all the time, and each time, the victors try to tell a historical narrative to prove their legitimacy while the fusion of cultures still exists in daily life and some physical objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental map in the brain often differs from the real physical world. As an Asian/Chinese, I could name almost all of Chinese provinces, their capitals, main terrains, as well as &amp;ldquo;big cities&amp;rdquo; in Western Europe, and lots of places in North America. At the same time, I was surprised to find out that the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco is less than 15 kilometers wide, Sicily is much closer to Tunis than Milan, and Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the most famous Greek cities in history, with a massive Greek community until Nasser took power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization, or cross-region and cross-continent communication, isn&amp;rsquo;t a new thing. Iconic buildings and landmarks become modern idolatry, and the world has more rough grainness before filters, which requires observation with closer distance and immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/e0aafe8519bbcc56a17bc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;granada&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 200~ days compared to 190~ last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my workout pattern become a bit different than before
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during workday, try to work on abs/back/chest for 3 times, and in summer, will go to cycling during sunset time with good weather for 12-20km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on weekends, have a loose rotation between cycling with group (70-90km), climbing with random friends, and swimming with Chenglin. oh yeah, almost missed that, this year i went swimming around 10 times and learned freestyle with help of Chenglin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do 1 hour yoga for weekends and 10 mins stretch everyday in the morning since November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my upper strength increases a lot this year, the pull-up bar are so useful and effective, at first, i need to pull up with 45kg resistance band, now i could do 2 pull-up (not good form but sill 😬).  The push-up increases from 7 dirty form to 15 clean form standard form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not hiking a lot, but becuase go for Haute Route in Switzerland this year, so still hike 267.7km in total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next year: improve freestyle swimming, also i&amp;rsquo;m interested in Calisthenics, didn&amp;rsquo;t see the possibility that i could do flag or planche next year hahaha but will see how much i could improve as standards in Convict Conditioning. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m in chest5, leg10, back5 and abs10. Next year hope to improve chest and back to 10, also work on spine and shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/31872a2b935738560926e.png&#34; alt=&#34;swiss&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party: 2rd year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host 12 dinner party this year in total (not including last time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second year, don&amp;rsquo;t feel any pressure, also less excited haha, now i feel this is more like a traditional ritual for my friend circle. This year, the close circle has some changes, first, Diane moves to Paris last October, and then Hnayang moved out to Donaghmede in the far north. Obviously, we hang out less frequently than before. Both Matthew and I traveled too much to be both in Dublin (?) But more close to Yangyang. Children will always grow up and leave home. 😂 I need to accept this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will still have Jarry&amp;rsquo;s living room next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9d874b25e10fc678dfe06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dinner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back the whole year, I realized the happeniss of this year is from friends (either friends in Dublin or friends around the world), my family, travel, music, movie and cycling.
I feel so grateful and lucky that I could have so many wonderful friends hanging out with me, taking care of me, give me support; I have a healthy body and some money to do the hobbies I like, the adventure I choose; all the people who create the amaizng films, albums, live music and books (still alive or in the history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next year, I will keep all this in mind, treasure my friends and family, pay and &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; for what I love by both actions and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020&amp;rsquo;s summary, I wrote &amp;ldquo;In the past few years, a persistent issue for me has been the frequent feeling of strangeness towards my past self and a sense of detachment from my past life.&amp;rdquo; The strangeness is not only from the environment, the friend circle, but also my behavior pattern and mindset.
It sounds weird, but this year is the first time that I truly accept the current me is real me. And I will keep it&amp;rsquo;s this stage of me and probably will change in the future.
Why I feel it&amp;rsquo;s something blue, in many novels, the main character goes through challenges and hardships, returning to their hometown having achieved some success, even becoming somewhat better in some ways. Along the way, they gain friends. Yet, despite the struggles being a story that can be shared with others, you still feel a sense of sadness, a sadness that might not even be rooted in loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried when I got onboarded on the flight back to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote notes back then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weeks in Dublin, before heading back to Asia after 3 yrs. When reflecting on the past three years, the cliche summary is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve become a better version of myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s often a tendency that we want to accumulate our possessions, the titles we hold, and indulge in fancy travels and experiences to show people our identity. But what if you were suddenly stripped of all that, thrown into a completely unfamiliar world where no one understands the labels from your previous life? Would you still recognize who you truly are? I keep questioning myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 29, I hope to keep living a simpler life with few things and not depending on lots of needs, yet savor all the love and support from my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“天上浮云如白衣，斯须改变如苍狗。
古往今来共一时，人生万事无不有。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a3030875034cbbe1fd2ad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jeju&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing probably should not categorize as blue. At the beginning of this year, I know M.D. got married by accident. It still arouses mixed feelings, which combine with &amp;ldquo;Oh he got married&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I feel happy for him because he must be love her, otherwise he won&amp;rsquo;t choose to be married.&amp;rdquo; He is the most important person who influences me in so many ways in my 20s, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be another person who have similar impact on me. But I will have still my 30s, 40s and etc on my own good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same as last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life is one with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy and Healthy, me and my loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>二零二一上半年总结</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_first_half/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 21:59:03 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2021_first_half/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;前几天在womenoverseas论坛里看到一个朋友分享的半年度总结用了something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue and a silver sixpence in her shoes来写生活中那些不变但是应该感谢的事, 新发生的事, 从别人身上获得的帮助, 悲伤的事以及对未来的展望. (ps和这个谚语的原本的指代有些不同), 借用来总结二零二一上半年.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-old&#34;&gt;1. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这半年来依然在我生活中的除了比较固定的习惯, 锻炼读书, 还有一些老朋友.比如周六要跟两个好友开半年度复盘总结会议, 苍蝇搓手&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我挺喜欢近几年的状态的&amp;hellip; 少担心睡眠好, 想做的事情就做了, 但另一个角度看, 这样的生活也很细碎, 拎不出一条脉络. 即使是兴趣爱好, 也是品类繁多, 时间精力投入全凭心情, 扔一边捡起来再扔一边. 没什么心理负担, 也少有attachment, 工作和交友的情况差不多相似&amp;hellip; 不过这种浮游的状态我也过了很多年, 习惯了&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;又给亲朋好友们安排了每年一度的杨梅, 该吃的人都吃到了.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-new&#34;&gt;2. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年或者是很长一段时间早上开始工作的时间比较晚, 加上中午午觉一两小时, 经常会工作到晚上九十点. 给身体造成了不大好的影响. 大约从三月中旬开始, 就设定了新的作息表, 早上九点开始工作到十二点, 下午两点开始工作到下午五点半, 之后就安排side project或者是social, 拍照, 锻炼. 最后发现该干的活也还是干完了&amp;hellip; 也没耽误完. 生活幸福感增加了不少.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从五月开始放弃了纸质planner, 开始用notion做weekly planner, weekly review, monthly review, 加上calendar, 发现效果不错&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五月的时候认识了Q姐姐, 终于开始在爱尔兰hiking! 至今去了Cork附近的两次海边, 还去了Tipperary, Waterford以及Kerry三个山, 两个是高山湖泊. 照片有发在IG. 除了徒步外, 还开始比之前频繁多的举铁和攀岩, 因为我上半身肌肉实在是太缺乏锻炼了&amp;hellip; 之前都是做力量瑜伽, 做这两种运动后统统变成拉伸瑜伽😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;五月写了三篇British Nature Writing的&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/doulist/140143022/&#34;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; 也读了好几本相关的书, 之后有兴趣再回来看吧&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;六月开始在爱尔兰街拍, 开启了一个新摄影项目 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/irishpubstudy/&#34;&gt;#irishpubstudy&lt;/a&gt; , 五月还学会了如何用capture one修图&amp;hellip; 之前都是用手机软件修的. 还买了个新镜头&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first two experience of shooting on the Cork streets, I found I was drawn attention by pubs. Then, I do some research about it and decide to start a personal project about Irish pubs. Because it combines with lots of topics I’m interested, such as microhistory, cultural history, public space, third places, inter-personal communication and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Covid, lots of Irish drink outside, which is a new trend,. Traditionally Irish pubs are inside with small or no-windows and Irish don’t drink outside as often as Italians and Spanish, partly because the weather in Ireland is not lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二月份确定了全职工作,  五月份开始了实习, 主要是做一个open-source project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vKubeViewer/vkubeviewer&#34;&gt;vkubeviewer&lt;/a&gt; (实习到七月底, 全职八月初开始, 无份衔接), 而且虽然dev只有两个人, 但我是tech lead(不是), 所以还要定dev plan, 和mentor沟通, 和pm沟通. 学习到蛮多&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;做菜技术提高了不少&amp;hellip; 举例, 我已经会做煎饺、寿司,、红烧鱼、红烧排骨、蒜烤鸡翅/排骨、羊肉烧烤, 独立搞一次家宴不成问题&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;跟人date超过两个月, 超过了之前的最长纪录. 我反思了下是这样的, 因为我不喜欢改变别人也不喜欢埋怨别人, 然后可能自己生活习惯太确定的, 经常会因为一些小地方感到不舒服, 但我会跳过沟通的环节, 直接finish&amp;hellip; 如果想拥有长期关系, 这点的确是需要改变一下. 不过比起一年前已经好太多了, 对进步感到满意, 觉得自己离long-term relationship只有一步之遥了&amp;hellip; 但对单身生活也感到快乐&amp;hellip; 还确定了自己可以结婚但不想生孩子(可能会变但目前的想法是这样)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有个是! 我参与了很多女性论坛, 比如说分享经验在豆瓣的women in tech小组, 还有womenoverseas论坛, 还参加了女性群体的social hour. 一年还是两年前比较认真的反思且被朋友们指出过我有些厌女. 现在可以共情很多以前不能共情的议题了. which i couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这半年里获得帮助最多的第一是我的mentor, 他人真的好好&amp;hellip; 我们这么一个简单和学校合作的实习项目, 只要他有空, 都会回答我的问题, 还有1:1, 还邀请很多人给我们career talk或者是interview. 还要感谢同学Epi, 从她身上也学习到很多跟人沟通合作的方式. 而且她安排我完全不用写论文, 只要写代码, 对此我太开心了&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;找工作期间联系了两个本科时的好朋友帮我mock interview (因为岗位一样) 有一个有一段时间没有联系了 对方已经成家生子还挺忙碌的 但还是热情地帮忙了 : ) 感谢&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还有要感谢的还是好友们了, 人生有一些志同道合的朋友还是很欣慰的, 虽然除了两个好友, 其他人日常都不联系, 但难得联系一次, 默契也都还在. 我到底是哪来的好运气&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上半年觉得爱尔兰天气还不错, 从三月中旬开始就有很多晴天, 下午结束工作会散步, 好像遇到雨天不是很多, 谢谢老天爷&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在科克认识的新朋友也很好, 生日那天朋友还特地给我做了三遍我爱喝的鸡尾酒, 还有芝士蛋糕(我是凌晨十一点半说的是我生日哈哈哈), 有的朋友带我hiking, 有的朋友带我认识新朋友, 有的朋友请我去家里吃饭, 大家都很好, 感恩的心&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;从五月份开始有只灰色母猫猫(白领斤+白手套)大约每周一次从后院翻墙来家里玩(蹭吃蹭喝)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我感觉到自己失去了一个好朋友&amp;hellip; 但我不太能理解到发生了什么, 我可能理解到发生了什么, 但理解不到对方为什么会因为发生的事情做了这样的决定, 然后我也不知道跟对方如何沟通&amp;hellip; emmm 但我目前好像是, 可以不解决的事情就先不解决&amp;hellip; 上一次发生类似的事情还是一六年&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前一段时间纠结过, 要不要工作几年跳到欧洲大陆, 后来做了一番研究, 决定就在爱尔兰待五年&amp;hellip; 所以长期计划是两年后换stamp4, 五年后考虑换身份的, 中间考虑买房&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺便做了一番不是很完善的提早退休计划&amp;hellip; 但计划过于模糊, 之后再谈😂 理想是四十岁吧&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;希望今年下半年或者明年年初能拿到驾照&amp;hellip; 我要hiking, 还有学好车等朋友来爱尔兰可以带他们去看鸟!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Dec 2020 21:40:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;二零二零年是特别忙碌和收获很大的一年, 感恩的心.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;self&#34;&gt;Self&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;近几年算持续困扰自己的问题是时常感到和过去自己的陌生感和过去生活的割裂感. 我对生活的掌握和稳定感来自有意识地保持一致性, 和老朋友保持联系, 定义明确的三观和行为准则. 但上一次大更新应该是16年, 而这几年间我的变化已经大到我需要曲解一些现实来匹配我的认知. 不过现在到了可以接受变化和更新的时间点了, 蛮开心的.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;friends&#34;&gt;Friends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;前段时间看到邹思聪的微博讲Cummings的一首诗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;直到他看着街边的一棵树，风吹着飘下了一片片的叶子，他跟我说，你知道E.E.Cummings吗？达达主义诗人。没等我回答，他拿出手机，给我看了一首诗，然后解释了起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l(a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;le&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;af&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iness]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他说你看，括号里面，是“一 片   树   叶   掉   下 来   了”，括号外面的字母，合起来就是“孤独”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他指着那些掉下来的叶子，你看叶子是怎么掉下来的，它们随风掉下来的时候，东摇西摆的，一片片的，无所依托的。这首诗重要的不是韵律，而是它的结构，你看这首诗里所有的字母，都被吹散了，摇摇晃晃，和现实一样，树叶就是这么掉下来的，它们都是化成一个个孤零零的字母，你看那个a，从上往下，划过的弧线，就是我们眼前的这片叶子，然后构成了整体的孤独。这就是Cummings的魅力，这就是我们的人生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先我承认人生就是很飘摇的,心灵整体的确是孤独的, 但不代表你不能再加一个括号, 外面是很多爱(心灵鸡汤上线&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l[l(a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;le&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;af&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;l&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iness]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ove&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020年我非常感谢几位朋友.
一月去扬州是和A同去的, 如果不是A, 我可能不会去扬州, 去了也不会关注腊梅啊, 园林植物啊, 园林设计啊. 谢谢她带给我新的视角. A也是对我诚恳地提出建设性批评意见最多的人, 虽然我没立刻改正, 但对很多事的态度从极端转向了相对温和.
B在短短几次见面后接纳我去她家吃饭和借宿, 感受到不是出于频繁交往而是出于互相欣赏的信任和友谊.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果说我早年的人际交往更多是对世界好奇的探索, 明面上很开放但对亲密的朋友有点疏离, 现在是对几个朋友可以敞开的状态.(也不要太敞开了, 成年人了还是要有尺寸感的).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;world&#34;&gt;World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总的来说, 比起逻辑我更依靠直觉, 很多事情的学习和体验更多是突发性和事后回顾的, 学习也经常没有体系, 也不爱做笔记, 喜欢输入很多信息量, 然后看在脑子里能发现什么连接. 对自己的期望是, 保持humble, 记得没有人是全知全能的, 在缺乏足够信息时少下判断, 在信息违背原先判断时承认错误, 修改判断.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;covid&#34;&gt;Covid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于全世界, 2020最大的是疫情. 上半年我的生活也受疫情影响很多, 更新了几篇相关日志, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/noc2/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202003_summary/&#34;&gt;瘟疫年纪事3&lt;/a&gt;, 就不赘述. 之后国内疫情缓和, 但九月在瑞丽旅游遭遇封城, 差点没赶上来爱尔兰的飞机, 也因此错失了和友人在上海的聚会, 实在是一大遗憾.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hiking&#34;&gt;Hiking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年最大的爱好是徒步,爵士乐已经沦为去年最爱😂 上半年主要是爬临海周边的山加看视频. 参见这篇博客&lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/hiking/&#34;&gt;徒步全家桶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;八九月玉龙雪山hike两次, 雨崩hike四条线. 连着四天, 每天徒步6+小时, 路线10k+, 海拔爬上500-1000m, 下山泡脚休息一晚上第二天继续上山. 爽爆了😊😊😊😊😊
大自然带来的震撼真的无法用语言描述(如果语文不好&amp;hellip;)
什么时候能去尼泊尔和阿尔卑斯,任何一个都行 :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;locality&#34;&gt;Locality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;今年拜访了扬州、景德镇、婺源特别是云南, 加上近两年在故乡的生活. 改变了我的身份认同. 这篇博客略微相关 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2020_08_repo/&#34;&gt;飞鸿踏雪泥&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;之前如果硬要选一个和地域相关的身份认同, 比起中国人我更偏好世界公民, 但如今更偏好浙南人, 最好具体到括苍山雁荡山区域. 这并非说我狭隘了, 按朋友的话讲, 我十分流畅地适应了爱尔兰的社交生活. 而是我既不想用一个国家的政治实体作为我的身份认同, 也不想用一个想象的虚拟实体. 自认为浙南人, 是这里的食物和风土构成了我的底色. 不要困在国籍里, 和具体的附近建立联系.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-in-cork&#34;&gt;Life in Cork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;来科克三个月, 感受: 我太适合这里的生活了&amp;hellip; 在国内我喜欢临海的生活节奏但找不到聊得来的朋友. 在上海可以找到朋友但我不喜欢在那里生活. 来科克发现这里人兴趣爱好广泛, 可能因为有音乐学院, 音乐爱好者好多.
好久没有讨论消费主义, 中产阶级生活方式、自我叙事了&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;hobby&#34;&gt;Hobby&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年总共听了一两百张专辑, 说一些特别喜欢的, 去年两月份写过一篇 &lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/202001_02_ablums/&#34;&gt;一二月刷砖小记&lt;/a&gt; 这里就只列三月之后的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quadro Nuevo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我真的很难相信这个充满了拉美气息的乐队是德国的(德国人在我印象里的确只是酸泡菜Krautrock😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mammal Hands
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;偶然间听到这个乐队, 之后跟着听了一批当代英国爵士, GoGo Penguin, Yussef Kamaal, The Comet is Coming, Matthew Halsall, 都很好听, 最喜欢的一首首Boreal Forest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stone Roses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;印象这一两年喜欢听歌也是19年听了他们的同名专辑, 特别喜欢, 那时候刚好也厌倦了流行歌曲, 又重新开始dig&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augustus Pablo
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamaica Reggae Dub 就雷鬼和dub有些就很吵, 所以Pablo的口琴对我而言比较能接受&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;时间线&#34;&gt;时间线&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;今年尝试的新玩意&#34;&gt;今年尝试的新玩意&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;攀岩&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;高原徒步&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;亲密关系&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>二零一九小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2019_summary/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 19:35:15 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/2019_summary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018年没有写小记，现在对全年的状态已经有些恍惚。所以今年还是要写。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19年的第一天说，&amp;ldquo;14年在和食欲、自我怀疑斗争 15-16年在和酒瘾、抑郁、自我否定斗争 17年在和焦虑、无意义感斗争 18年可以说是第一次获得inner peace的一年。&amp;rdquo; 这个年末最想说，自己是个幸福的人（？今年真的很开心，觉得一切都很好。特别是朋友们，每次见朋友心里可能都在唱歌（？）最大的感概是：二十岁以前都在和精神创伤struggle，时不时会伤害到身边的人，今年发现自己常常能给朋友们带来快乐和安慰，挺开心的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;负面影响是过于平和，甚至有点快乐的虚假。时常感到自己把负面的情绪或者是想法刻意地忽略。对细微之处的感受力也下降了。有时候都要对自己说：不要太开心，要思考！&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;香港的事对我影响很大，第一次想离开，中间有些应急创伤的表现，之一是年中对中国的东西有抵触的情绪，看书基本不看国内作者，小说读原文，也不想读国内历史。模模糊糊中在自我认知中突出了自己是南方人，感觉是在不喜欢主流中国叙事和喜欢中国的某些部分的折衷选择，毕竟我们江南人儒学都是黄宗羲顾炎武，还有东南互保。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;上半年和下半年挺不一样的，上半年又拧巴了，浑浑噩噩的，一边喝了很多酒（可能超过三次喝多了），一边“疯狂跑步”，获得了5km25min以内的成就（这是今年最后一次说了，再也不说了&amp;hellip;）马来回来突然心变宽阔了，做了个决定，努力学习，九月很努力地学了雅思，考了7.5（我还挺擅长考试的&amp;hellip;）十月弄材料，十一月十二月是算法。一边工作一边学习，时间梭梭过去。下半年着实很忙碌，又要赚钱又要照顾弟弟又要学习还要锻炼/读书/喝酒etc&amp;hellip; 忙碌后很难有经历讨论抽象问题和大问题。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还是没有对象的一年，连和人建立友情关系都是每年一两个的。但也意识到，多元的关系支撑着我的生活。也想明白，在relationship上有点想settle down，但在生活上还不想settle down。我也不是能换个生活状态就换个对象的人，当然身边也有朋友辗转多年辗转世界各地最后生活上也都settle down的，这……我不奢求。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有天说“作为业余读者，我应该既不左派又不女权，自己给自己贴标签是历史社会和类型小说爱好者，平等自由观念的绝对主义者，在文化多样性上是个相对主义者，着迷于历史的细节和复杂性，可以聊抽象建构，可以解构但没推到极端的虚无。即使世界是幻象，这个幻想也足够真实。几乎讨厌所有的“本质”问题，可以快速地对事物下判断，即使是错了也没事，知道错了再调整就可以了。” 这差不多总结了现在的三观，还发现如果硬要套标签，以前我是个政治左，经济右，现在经济光谱逐渐左移。例如，以前我非常支持自由市场，不喜欢任何形式的税收和福利制度。但现在我的观点是：不是经济而是政治经济，经济力量会自然地寻找政治力量的合谋。在这种情况下，只有用理想的好的政治力量去建立保护弱者的制度。（假设制度合理）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;《一七年小记》里说“去年一月的感受是“最好把所有的输入渠道都‘调教’成可流动的状态，大概的意思是社交上想要认识新朋友，渠道abc有一些备选，也会有些新的人加入；信息上控制信息源，关注的话题肯定有，另外也会时不时出现一些没接触的概念、问题。以此逐渐延伸自己的触角。”过了一年，这个想法依然持续。” 今年还想到沟通和理解的问题，思路有点像17年和朋友谈过的&lt;a href=&#34;https://jarrywangcn.github.io/post/whatsaboutmeaning/&#34;&gt;定义&lt;/a&gt;“所有对客观存在的评价都是一对客观存在（reality）和观点（viewpoint）的couple，客观存在只有一个，但观点会有我的观点（Vi），个体A的观点（Va），某些个体组成的某个群体的观点（Vgroup），主流的观点（Vmainstream）甚至理论上存在一个全集的观点（Vall）” 我想的是，如果两个人聊起同一个事物，脑内是不同的圆，并集有大有小。比方说性别，生理性别+心理性别都为女性，大家都认同是女性，很容易在并集里。但边缘的case，生理性别女+心理性别男在不同人的定义里更可能不一样。其他事物也是一样的。存在一段时间的领域，都有一些不能躲避的问题或者概念或者其他什么，不管是什么路径，总会遇到的。大多数领域都有经典化的整理过程，新领域就是一片混沌的战场了。既要看到作为结果的经典，也要看到结果之前的可能性。所以学习更多，把触角延伸到更多的领域，还可以增进和别人的交流（? 这也是我为什么越来越少不跟陌生人沟通，任何人的观念是受限于ta的成长经历甚至是其他学科知识，成年人是没法从单一点驳倒的，前置太多了，三观不是个纯思辨问题，是实践相关的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;不能适应国内大都市生活了。
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;这不是说我不爱城市了。我对城市的兴趣引导我读了很多书。&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.douban.com/doulist/45028941/&#34;&gt;城市研究 地方史 当代移民&lt;/a&gt;。至今也能享受大城市的快乐，每次去上海探亲找朋友玩都很开心。但知道我没有承受其中的代价，会让我有罪恶感。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我的三观就是反消费主义的。虽然偶尔在社交上为了做个平和的人，不怎么批判。在我的三观里，所有过度的买买买，占有超出自己需要的物品就是不好的。如果兴趣爱好是昆虫，收集了超多的标本，这是另一回事。这里我自己也没想清楚，或者说，我理想的是尽量把物品作为物品，而不是更看重它背后的符号和一些其他的东西。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有些特别开心的事：
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;二月在东湖公园发现特别美的梅花树（初恋梅花树）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;跑了两次杭州两次上海，交到了两个新朋友！&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;旅行去了十多天广西，十多天马来西亚，短暂去了天台、泉州、广州、福州。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;夏天的芒果和西瓜很好吃。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;春天和夏天经常逛园子。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;寄的杨梅朋友们都很喜欢。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;隔了多年又从音乐中获得快乐。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还干了些乱七八糟的事：（发现自己真是个爱学习的人&amp;hellip;但通常玩到80分就懒得挖下去了&amp;hellip;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;冬天练了一段时间瑜伽（上墙倒立！）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;精酿啤酒的兴趣爱好有80分，基本上所有的品类，市面上能见到的大厂小厂都喝过吧。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;咖啡就简单喝了下，会做手冲了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;是个出门会带跑鞋和茶具的没有条件也要创造条件的年轻人了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;做饭比去年好吃了一丢丢。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;更新了12篇博客，3篇是读书总结，写了两篇认真的书评。（虽然不行，但好像还能写？）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;看到年初的某个flag。
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读12本英文书（10/12）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;读5本德语书（0/5）&lt;/li&gt;
