      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-new&#34;&gt;1. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopt a cat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopting Morty has been one of the most important things for me this year, even though it only began in October. It reflects a profound shift within me—an acceptance of responsibility, even if it’s for a cat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know myself well, and I’ve always tended to avoid responsibility whenever possible. While I’ve lived with cats before, this is the first time I’ve truly felt the weight of being solely responsible for a living being. Providing Morty with a stable life—ensuring his food, environment, and companionship—is now my duty, and I’ve embraced this reality. I even feel guilty if I go out too often in a week, which used to be natural for me. 🙃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After returning from Malta, I began house viewings and got sale agreed within two weeks—remarkably quick. Navigating the mortgage and insurance process went smoothly, but moving in May was overwhelming. Managing utilities, internet, furniture purchases and assembly, packing, and unpacking felt like an endless task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m still unsure if this marks a significant milestone for me. The decision was driven by financial considerations, yet I feel no emotional attachment to owning a home. My lifestyle remains unchanged—I still live with housemates, socialize with friends, and occasionally date. It hasn’t impacted my cash flow or consumption habits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, many view homeownership as a hallmark of adulthood—so perhaps it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing, scuba diving, swimming, dancing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, I wasn’t obsessed with anything in particular—just exploring outside my comfort zone. Having spent years doing lower-body-intensive sports like running, cycling, and hiking, I decided to focus on water sports this year. That’s why I took up swimming and scuba diving. While I’m far from an expert, the goal was to feel more at ease in water and to unlock the experience of exploring an underwater world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also try dancing for a similar reason, as it’s a way to express emotions physically rather than through words or thoughts. I tried salsa and swing, finding swing suit me better—though it clearly requires more practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing has been a bigger focus, heavily influenced by friends like West, Alexis, Valerie, and Josh. I love outdoor rope climbing, as it immerses me in nature in a unique way. Feeling the texture of the rocks and being grounded in the moment has become deeply fulfilling. It&amp;rsquo;s also a interesting way for travel and make friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/owtsA3F.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience, Connection, Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year has been filled with memorable trips that deepened my bonds with friends. In Spain, Qingyue and I grew close for the first time after three years of knowing each other. In the UK, I shared in Ruoxi&amp;rsquo;s milestone moment at her PhD graduation. In the USA, I reconnected with Michael, reliving memories from our graduation eight years ago and making new memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These journeys stirred profound emotions, prompting me to write heartfelt reflections on Instagram after each trip, expressing gratitude for the people and moments shared. I even updated my status to include “Experience, Connection, Love” alongside “Cosmopolitanism, localism, culture, and history.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my younger years, I focused on achievement—not for recognition, but to push myself forward. Recent years, however, I start to value deep, meaningful connections with people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my funeral, I hope people remember not just the remarkable things I achieved but the joy and laughter I brought into their lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get more feedback about I&amp;rsquo;m supportive and how I influence them in a good way 😬&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get less avoidant and become more safe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank God, I no longer attract anxious types, nor am I drawn to broken people anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From April to July, I had 12 sessions with the therapist I saw two years ago. Initially, it was to address being triggered by a dating experience, but our discussions soon delved into childhood trauma. I came to realize how challenging life was from ages 8 to nearly 25, with lingering scars still present. Confronting these wounds, reminding myself “I am different now, my life has changed, I can choose new behaviors, and I am safe,” was incredibly hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m deeply grateful for undertaking this inner work, even though it’s been difficult. In return, I become more sensitive to people&amp;rsquo;s emotions as well as mine. &amp;ldquo;Pay money to therapist and learn how to be angry at my friends&amp;rdquo; 🤣&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/8SQJwpj.png&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Hungary - Budapest, Slovakia - Bratislava, Malta (9 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: Netherlands - Amsterdam, Leiden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May:  Spain - Santander, Mallorca (10 days) w/ Qingyue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Galway (2 days) w/ Kenzie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: UK - London, Cambridge (6 days) w/ Ruoxi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: Greece - Athens, Geogeria, Armenia (14 days) w/ Damon, Hanyang, Matthew, Diane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: USA - New York, Chicago (9 days) w/ Michael, West, Alexis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: Egypt - Alexsanderia, Cairo, Dahab (17 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 213 days compared to 207 last year. feel good about the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprised to compare data and see how much i get stronger. The end of last year, i could only do 2 pull-up, in 2024, once i could do 10 pull-up in a row (now drop to 6). And push-up is easy 20 compare to 15. I don&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to calisthenics because i&amp;rsquo;m more interested in performance on climbing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m satified on my current state related to strength, cardio and flexibility&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next year: improve performance on climbing, target is 6A, and more water sports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party: 3rd year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host 9 dinner party the whole year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year the permanent seat belongs to Hanyang, Yangyang and Damon. Matthew moved to Berlin after March, Damon will move to London next year. Have more once-a-while guests. And because the dinning table in my house becomes smaller, the crew becomes smaller too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanyang hosts lots of memorable dinner party, I gave her &amp;ldquo;host of the year&amp;quot;🫡&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to think make more close friends in Dublin 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/rXLLjae.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on 2024, I’m surprised that how I’ve almost forgotten the challenges I faced at the start of the year. I feel quite lost in early spring after three years of full-time work. A dating experience triggered me and led me back to therapy, while the stress of moving to a new home weighed heavily on me. I even found myself angry at close friends for not helping — then realize I hadn’t asked for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My therapist once said, “How people emerge from difficulties isn’t shaped solely by their experiences, but by the support they receive during those times.” Perhaps that’s why these struggles haven’t left scars—because my friends stood by me, turning pain into fleeting moments rather than lasting wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nothing worth writing here XD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this year has felt calm—continuing along familiar paths with no extreme highs or unexpected lows. Perhaps learning to embrace a steady, uneventful year is part of the rhythm of middle-aged life. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this year I could follow my plans to achieve retire early and this requires some time and efforts, let&amp;rsquo;s see 🤞🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishes are the same as last year, hope to live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy and Healthy, me and my loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-something-new&#34;&gt;1. Something new&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First year cyling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cycling is definitely the most important hobby for me this year. From strava, it shows i cycled 2500km. If taking commute into consideration, would be around 3000km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Clontarf Cycling Club. ngl, the club is super Irish and middle-aged people over 40, 50, 60 and i&amp;rsquo;m a outlier. However, learned a lot from them and every time group spin, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge and fun to push myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cycling not only gives me the way to exercise, but also brings me to lots of places around Dublin i&amp;rsquo;ve never been. Before I never go out of Dublin city center. But this year, i&amp;rsquo;ve been to Bray, Dalkey, Wicklow, Enniskerry, Killakee, Glencullen in the south, Portmarnock, Malahide, Swords, Skerries in the north, Lucan in the south. (Sorry, this is all the village names around Dublin suburbs.) And the group always guided me to lovely cute local coffee shop. This is the most authentic Irish experience for me as an immigrants 😂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First 100km in Feb &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/fd8aea2cb5464ccfac830.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;100km&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wicklow spin in May, Sally gap - Wicklow gap, i look so young with the group XD &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/b447f75857c79a5e3b73a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wicklow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike Touring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing cycling brings me is bike touring. As traveling after so many years, i know my preference is to go to local places (don&amp;rsquo;t need to be famous) and see how local people&amp;rsquo;s daily lifes and behaviors. However, because i can&amp;rsquo;t drive, i&amp;rsquo;m limited to the places I could reach by public transportation. This year, because of bike touring, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen lots of interesting but niche places, as well as enjoying cycling at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots of memorable spins and a bit risky &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo; because of bike touring, such as cycle on southern freeway (Autopista Sur), carrying bike while hiking in Tenerife&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most memorable one is in Naples, I rented a bike for 3 days there. Here&amp;rsquo;s the travel notes taken back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I only stayed in the central area of Naples and had a biased impression of this multi-layered city. The closely-built, narrow alleys reminded me of the urban villages in Guangzhou. But if you go to the west coast and climb up the hill, the vibe of the neighborhood is similar to Mid-Levels in Hong Kong. It&amp;rsquo;s also similar to Lisbon and Istanbul in some ways. As it turns out, there must be some common patterns to developing cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycled to Pompeii, around Mount Vesuvius, and experienced the stone road, which made my hands and butt vibrate all the way and met traffic jam in literally every single town!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in napoli are very confident drivers, both cars and motors. They turn without signal lights, pass aside you within 0.5m. In the crossings, most of time no traffic lights, people need to negotiate with hands, facial expressions, beeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People parked anywhere, anytime. Parked 2 Columns on the same side of roads. Parked in the crossings. Parked suddenly to speak to passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn’t see any accident, I would say it’s a super good self-organized society 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a ferry with my bike to Ischia and had a thermal spring bath at Baia di Sorgeto, where had to manually mix the cold sea water with hot spring water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Bike Touring in Malaga, firt time with Clip Shoes and Fall, February &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/3fcb4bc8092b91c7fae01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Malaga&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Climb this year in Tenerife, March! &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/453d998c77ad67d83449f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Teide&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naples in April, on the west coast looking to Vesuvius &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a36cc155ffce675286d01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Naples&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusseldorf along Rhine River in June, cycle with Diane &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/07ee84835ea222ef12da0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dusseldorf&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erhai Greenway, Dali in October &lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9957c90caba38e2da1699.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dali&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get promotion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t talk much about work because i&amp;rsquo;m not ambitious on career. But still, this year i&amp;rsquo;ve made so much progress as a software engineer. Looking back, i almost didn&amp;rsquo;t do any solid work in the first one year and half. For example, i haven&amp;rsquo;t made any commits in my team&amp;rsquo;s core packages, either C or Rust. But since April, I picked a very technical challenging project in Rust. So I had a steep learning curve on Rust, then our core package&amp;hellip; Then I picked another bigger both technical and design difficult project both in Go and Rust, also need to lead 2 new graduate teammates&amp;hellip; In the end, I finished them all, from knowing nothing to deliver results as well as own a big project. Then I got promoted&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often find myself starting things just as I cross the bottem passing grade, which makes the process somewhat painful, but leads to significant progress. Last year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even complete a two-day hiking trail, when i start to hike in Dolomites over 170+ kilometers…  This year, after just 2 months of owning a road bike, I joined a cycling club with the shortest group spin is over 70km. When I first got into DJing last year, I immediately started making friends in the DJ community. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt uncomfortable that I might be less skilled compared to someone else; instead, I&amp;rsquo;m always amazed by their talents and skills. I openly share what I&amp;rsquo;m into with almost everyone, which leads to more chances of serendipitously meeting like-minded people and engaging with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 3 years, I&amp;rsquo;m back in China. Actually i don&amp;rsquo;t feel strange. I still have lots of friends who could hangout together and have surprisling(&amp;hellip;) strong connection and mutal understanding. My fav pub in town still open, fav restaurant still open. Stay probably 3 weeks at home, had some family time with mom, Tiantian and Kangkang. And stay over with so many friend&amp;rsquo;s house. Thx for hosting me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/27a197f7b9a15c890c19a.png&#34; alt=&#34;china_2023&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel and stay with friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a reserved attitute about traveling with friends, the reasons are complicated and mixed. Partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable to stay with people together, partly because i don&amp;rsquo;t believe I could still keep having fun with one person. Partly because i like having adventure alone. Traveling solo will give me a adventurous feeling. But with my comfort zone with people progressing, I&amp;rsquo;ve arranged several trips with friends this year (sometimes one person, sometimes two.) Most of time, it goes well. Even something annoyed happened, I will communicate about it in the end. I do detect i don&amp;rsquo;t have fight or run situation for long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get stamp 4 (a work permit in Ireland, which don&amp;rsquo;t need company&amp;rsquo;s sponsorship)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t make lots of new friends this year, still meet  new people, sometimes during traveling, sometimes in Dublin, but not close and don&amp;rsquo;t have time to hangout. maybe i&amp;rsquo;m already very comfortable with current friend circle but anyways, why all the friends should be close friends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-something-old&#34;&gt;2. Something old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keep traveling: 78 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: Portugal - Faro (2 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February &amp;amp; March: Spain - Malaga, Granada, Tenerife (10 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March &amp;amp; April: Italy - Rome, Neplas (11 days) w/ John, Frances, Wayne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Germany - Koln, Dusseldorf (3 days) w/ Diane; Spain - Barcelona (5 days) w/ Matthew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: Swizterland &amp;amp; France - Geneva, Chamonix, Zermatt, Zurich (15 days) w/ Wayne, John, Frances, West, Alex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September &amp;amp; October: Hong Kong (2 days); China - Chaozhou, Shanghai, Suzhou, Linhai (12 days); Korean - Jeju (5 days) w/ Josh, Ying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: China - Dali (5 days) w/ Donglai &amp;amp; Iris; Hong Kong (1 day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus regions for me this year is South Europe, especailly Spain and Italy. Quote my instagram post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 3-4 months, I visited the following cities in South Europe around the Mediterranean Sea: Portugal&amp;rsquo;s Lisbon and Faro, Spain&amp;rsquo;s Malaga, Granada and Barcelona, and Italy&amp;rsquo;s Rome, Naples. If looking back a bit further, also visited Turkey&amp;rsquo;s Istanbul, Izmir, Fethiye and Antalya. Could say had a rough impression of the north Mediterranean area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in a region with a long, stable cultural history (Zhejiang is one of China&amp;rsquo;s core cultural regions since the Song Dynasty), I feel fascinated and amazed by how many culturally diverse influences have shaped the Mediterranean, including Carthage, Rome, the Byzantine Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Arabic, and Moors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the cities I&amp;rsquo;ve visited have historical sites left by the Romans, Arabs, Carthaginians and Ottoman Turks. Over a long period, these empires&#39; borders have experienced expansion and contraction. What were once mosques have become churches in Granada, and what were once churches have become mosques in Istanbul. The alternation of civilizations happens all the time, and each time, the victors try to tell a historical narrative to prove their legitimacy while the fusion of cultures still exists in daily life and some physical objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental map in the brain often differs from the real physical world. As an Asian/Chinese, I could name almost all of Chinese provinces, their capitals, main terrains, as well as &amp;ldquo;big cities&amp;rdquo; in Western Europe, and lots of places in North America. At the same time, I was surprised to find out that the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco is less than 15 kilometers wide, Sicily is much closer to Tunis than Milan, and Alexandria, Egypt, was one of the most famous Greek cities in history, with a massive Greek community until Nasser took power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globalization, or cross-region and cross-continent communication, isn&amp;rsquo;t a new thing. Iconic buildings and landmarks become modern idolatry, and the world has more rough grainness before filters, which requires observation with closer distance and immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/e0aafe8519bbcc56a17bc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;granada&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physical health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year i&amp;rsquo;ve exercised for 200~ days compared to 190~ last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my workout pattern become a bit different than before
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during workday, try to work on abs/back/chest for 3 times, and in summer, will go to cycling during sunset time with good weather for 12-20km.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on weekends, have a loose rotation between cycling with group (70-90km), climbing with random friends, and swimming with Chenglin. oh yeah, almost missed that, this year i went swimming around 10 times and learned freestyle with help of Chenglin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do 1 hour yoga for weekends and 10 mins stretch everyday in the morning since November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my upper strength increases a lot this year, the pull-up bar are so useful and effective, at first, i need to pull up with 45kg resistance band, now i could do 2 pull-up (not good form but sill 😬).  The push-up increases from 7 dirty form to 15 clean form standard form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not hiking a lot, but becuase go for Haute Route in Switzerland this year, so still hike 267.7km in total&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;next year: improve freestyle swimming, also i&amp;rsquo;m interested in Calisthenics, didn&amp;rsquo;t see the possibility that i could do flag or planche next year hahaha but will see how much i could improve as standards in Convict Conditioning. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m in chest5, leg10, back5 and abs10. Next year hope to improve chest and back to 10, also work on spine and shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dinner party: 2rd year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host 12 dinner party this year in total (not including last time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second year, don&amp;rsquo;t feel any pressure, also less excited haha, now i feel this is more like a traditional ritual for my friend circle. This year, the close circle has some changes, first, Diane moves to Paris last October, and then Hanyang moved out to Donaghmede in the far north. Obviously, we hang out less frequently than before. Both Matthew and I traveled too much to be both in Dublin (?) But more close to Yangyang. Children will always grow up and leave home. 😂 I need to accept this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will still have Jarry&amp;rsquo;s living room next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/9d874b25e10fc678dfe06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dinner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-something-borrowed&#34;&gt;3. Something borrowed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back the whole year, I realized the happeniss of this year is from friends (either friends in Dublin or friends around the world), my family, travel, music, movie and cycling.
I feel so grateful and lucky that I could have so many wonderful friends hanging out with me, taking care of me, give me support; I have a healthy body and some money to do the hobbies I like, the adventure I choose; all the people who create the amaizng films, albums, live music and books (still alive or in the history).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next year, I will keep all this in mind, treasure my friends and family, pay and &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; for what I love by both actions and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;4-something-blue&#34;&gt;4. Something blue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020&amp;rsquo;s summary, I wrote &amp;ldquo;In the past few years, a persistent issue for me has been the frequent feeling of strangeness towards my past self and a sense of detachment from my past life.&amp;rdquo; The strangeness is not only from the environment, the friend circle, but also my behavior pattern and mindset.
It sounds weird, but this year is the first time that I truly accept the current me is real me. And I will keep it&amp;rsquo;s this stage of me and probably will change in the future.
Why I feel it&amp;rsquo;s something blue, in many novels, the main character goes through challenges and hardships, returning to their hometown having achieved some success, even becoming somewhat better in some ways. Along the way, they gain friends. Yet, despite the struggles being a story that can be shared with others, you still feel a sense of sadness, a sadness that might not even be rooted in loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried when I got onboarded on the flight back to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote notes back then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weeks in Dublin, before heading back to Asia after 3 yrs. When reflecting on the past three years, the cliche summary is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve become a better version of myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s often a tendency that we want to accumulate our possessions, the titles we hold, and indulge in fancy travels and experiences to show people our identity. But what if you were suddenly stripped of all that, thrown into a completely unfamiliar world where no one understands the labels from your previous life? Would you still recognize who you truly are? I keep questioning myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 29, I hope to keep living a simpler life with few things and not depending on lots of needs, yet savor all the love and support from my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“天上浮云如白衣，斯须改变如苍狗。
古往今来共一时，人生万事无不有。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://telegraph-image-3d3.pages.dev/file/a3030875034cbbe1fd2ad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jeju&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing probably should not categorize as blue. At the beginning of this year, I know M.D. got married by accident. It still arouses mixed feelings, which combine with &amp;ldquo;Oh he got married&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I feel happy for him because he must be love her, otherwise he won&amp;rsquo;t choose to be married.&amp;rdquo; He is the most important person who influences me in so many ways in my 20s, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will be another person who have similar impact on me. But I will have still my 30s, 40s and etc on my own good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-a-silver-sixpence&#34;&gt;5. a silver sixpence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same as last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a psychologically rich life is one with “interesting experiences in which novelty and/or complexity are accompanied by profound changes in perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy and Healthy, me and my loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>一七年小记</title>
      <link>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/notes_of_2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 15:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jarrywangcn.github.io/posts/notes_of_2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/2913d48ea31d602.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TITLE&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;去年一月的感受是“最好把所有的输入渠道都‘调教’成可流动的状态，大概的意思是社交上想要认识新朋友，渠道abc有一些备选，也会有些新的人加入；信息上控制信息源，关注的话题肯定有，另外也会时不时出现一些没接触的概念、问题。以此逐渐延伸自己的触角。”过了一年，这个想法依然持续。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;成长过程受互联网影响很深，五六月份意识到自己和世界的接口太多了（包括各种社交网站 通信方式）。有意识地控制自己说什么，不说什么，废弃了一些接口。现在出门，就是强制offline，不听歌不上网。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用时间管理的方式建立日常生活是受大环境影响的，如果出生在另一个时代/另一种文明的平行世界，实现同样目标的方式或许会截然不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读了120多本书，除去画册、摄影集、食谱，只有110本，其中非虚拟和虚拟各占55本。
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Picture2.png&#34; alt=&#34;book&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;读了不少历史，读历史于我，还是为了理解现在。布罗代尔说“刚刚过去的过去和多多少少遥远的过去合在一起构成了现在的多重性。新近的历史以高速度向我们冲来，更早一些的历史则以较为缓慢的速度、较为隐秘的方式伴随着我们。”更趋于专题阅读，去年两个大头分别是：长江中上游地区近代史、以茶叶为线索的传播和交流史。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul A. Cohen, 历史三调&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王笛, 茶馆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;王笛, 街头文化&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe, 红雨: 一个中国县域七个世纪的暴力史&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe, 汉口: 一个中国城市的冲突和社区(1796-1895)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William T.Rowe	, 汉口: 一个中国城市的商业和社会（1796-1889）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernest Borschmann	, 西洋镜：一个德国建筑师眼中的中国1906—1909&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;何智亚, 四川古镇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Fortune	, 两访中国茶乡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fa-ti Fan, 清代在华的英国博物学家 : 科学.帝国与文化遭遇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Rose, For All the Tea in China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;陈慈玉, 生津解渴: 中国茶叶的全球化&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可以把书中的小说单独拎出来，小说的本质是讲故事，电影也是，叙事强的游戏也是。这三类属于可互相替代的文化消费品。小说读的越来越少，可电影看了很多，对故事的需求就满足了。跟去年比，今年玩了几个游戏，会关注的有两类： a.玩法独特的小游戏，像frame，gorogoa, b. 叙事性强的，玩游戏的过程像看电影 her story，life is strange。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;影像（包括电影、图片、游戏画面）讲故事的优势在于浸入感和感官体验，理性思考还得靠承载逻辑的语言（文字），流程图和示意图是特殊的图像。看历史片 图像上呈现的服饰，也得转化成“xx年代某某地的人穿xx样式的衣服”才能成为脑中的认知。游戏除了控制角色/可以选择带来的浸入感外，还能提供更多的文本（对话、书籍/纸张上的文字、物体间的关系、属性/技能/参数），解谜的过程涉及更多的思考。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;没去太多地方，虽然大大小小旅行加起来也有50多天，主要就是在广佛地区、川渝地区周边跑，还去了趟越南。（每年跑三个区域）没那么喜欢出去玩了，认为拍照成为旅行的主要内容是偷懒地代替了思考，不拍标志性建筑/符号，是一种审美判断。去越南虽是破罐子破摔式出行，但遭遇还不错，有两个人至今印象清晰。在西贡认出了一棵树，三年前是白天，这次是深夜。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;广佛地区
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-02%20at%208.12.57%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;川渝地区
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Picture3.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;越南&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ohvamo1vj.bkt.clouddn.com/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-02%20at%208.12.42%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;travel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;摄影是一种简单易取得信息的方式，你可以用流程化粗暴的方式处理不同的素材，而对被拍摄的物体几乎没有认知。随着技术的进步，可以分割画面中的元素，但拍摄是能获取的只有整块。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;认知的变化：传统和现代不是对立的，现代化是一个连续的过程，新旧不是拿来刻意对比的。就像一座城墙，伫立了很多年，从剖面看，不同时期用了不同的建筑材料和工艺，能明显看出变化和区分，但它依然是一个整体。这个变化也是有脉络的，社会也是这样。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;建筑无古今之分，一切历史建筑它们设计之初，所面对的语境是一样的。好的建筑具有时间连续性和空间连续性，时间连续性是历代更替时修修补补到今天，空间连续性是它们总是和社区、周边的自然环境紧密融合在一起，不仅仅是单一建筑的设计，而是场所空间的设计。”（豆瓣心匠）拍老建筑不是为了怀旧，还是喜欢老建筑，但要处理更当代的素材。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;找到了新的观看的角度，也重新看到想拍的东西，但没有找到自己的视觉语言。当年无意识的街拍，是确信有和别人不一样的东西，对于新的素材，还没有找到 ，暂时采取不处理的方式，对此不是很满意。想要拍有history resonance和复杂性的东西。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果有一个存在称为“谜”，用语言接近它已经到达语言的极限，毕竟语言是一种框架，框架意为某种程度的限制，那就用图像去接近它。时间不可逆，摄影是最好的，当代研究。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;承认自己很不能写，或者说已经不擅长用文字来表达，更擅长谈话，很多思路都是在谈话中清晰的。中文退步的很快，第一次用历史的角度看现代汉语（以前只有文言文、半文言、白话文的概念），受两篇文章的影响较大：李陀《汪曾祺鱼现代汉语写作——兼谈毛文体》、陈力卫《汉语欧化过程中的日语因素》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;私人写作和公共写作是分开的，不那么爱谈自己了，公共写作又没什么能提供有价值观点的领域，表达欲就降低了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;流行通信，第58期，嘉宾是阿角，说15年自己是个完整的人，现在是个残缺的人。人如果把自己打开，就会被人践踏，被一些事所伤害，就被打碎了。一月和五月完全碎成了渣，整个后半年全在日常生活和独处中疗愈，目前是个相对完整的人。其实完整久了自己就会找事情被打碎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人生最我来说最值得期待的不是自己会做什么事，去什么地方（通常这些我会有计划，太长期的无法预见但两三年总可以），而是内在的变化（性格 、思维方式），当事物给予刺激时，无意识的反应，目前为止每年都不一样。要内观，受到某个刺激，要知道自己行为的缘起，对自己的决定有所洞察。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;以前说过:如果驾驶一辆列车,对方行来一辆列车,我是会加速撞上去的那种人（类比在生活中是如果有个小矛盾,我会把它激化&amp;hellip; 然后摊牌解决）现在第一想的是:如果立刻踩刹车，不撞的可能性多大；如果撞了如何减小冲击力，降低负面影响。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人事上难过的多，给予安慰的都是老朋友。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;代办事项永远做不完，书永远读不完，一个疑惑解决了总有新的疑惑，完整久了又想被打碎，希望平静中有力量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;二十億光年的孤獨&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;谷川俊太郎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;地球人在小小的地球上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;睡覺 蘇醒 和 工作&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有時想和火星人做朋友&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;火星人在小小的火星上&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;做著什麼 我不清楚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;或許在睡覺 打扮 和 苦惱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但我確信他們&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有時想和地球人做朋友&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;萬有引力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;是互相吸引的孤獨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宇宙正在拉扯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家於是渴望相識&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;宇宙飛快膨脹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大家為此感到憂愁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;對著二十億光年的孤獨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我忍不住打了個噴嚏&lt;/p&gt;
